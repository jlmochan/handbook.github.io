			<div class="text-content">You are not alone.  If you are a new Director of Facilities, there are many resources available for you when help is needed.  The New York State School Facilities Association (NYSSFA) provides a wealth of training materials, educational webinars, training classes (most are through the School Facilities Management Institute (SFMI)), electronic mailing lists, and weekly communication newsletters.  You will have a local NYSSFA chapter whose membership includes your peers and colleagues from neighboring districts.  Get involved in your local chapter as soon as possible.  The worst excuse for not participating in NYSSFA meetings, both at local and at the state level, is that “I am too busy.”  You will always be busy in your district, but opportunities for professional development are not always available.  If you are out of the district at times, work will be waiting for you when you return. When valuable educational classes are offered, a wise Director finds ways to take advantage of them.  The Director of Facilities position is one in which there is always room for growth and self-improvement.  We cannot stress enough the value of seizing opportunities to increase your knowledge and skills sets applicable to the ever-evolving role that is the Director of Facilities. <br><br>
			
			This handbook has been created to act as a quick reference guide for you to use in the daily and routine performance of your duties.  As such, it is not intended to replace the multitude of professional development classes that are offered by NYSSFA and SFMI.  We trust that you will also find this to be a great resource for basic knowledge concerning day-to-day activities that you will be involved in. </div>

<!--PROCUREMENT SECTION-->
		
		<div id="section-procurement" class="tab-content">
		<div class="topic-header">PROCUREMENT</div>
			
			<div class="text-content">Each district has a purchasing policy and reviewing that policy is one of the first things you will do in your district.  Your Business Administrator will typically go over the district’s purchasing guidelines with you so you know what steps you must take to acquire goods and services.  We’ll outline each of these steps below.<br><br>
			<h3><strong>Get Quotes</strong></h3><br>
			This is a common option for buying goods or services.  You district purchasing policy will dictate how many quotes you need to acquire.  This is based on the amount of purchase you are seeking.  For example, your district may require 3 quotes for anything over $500, and 2 quotes for anything between $250 and $500.  There is also a maximum purchase allowance with quotes and that is $25,000 for materials and up to $35,000 if it is for materials and labor.  Equipment purchases can be the exception to this rule.<br><br>
			<h3>Equipment Purchases</h3><br>
			<p>You should have a line item in your budget for Capital Equipment purchases.  The amount you have in that budget account is set when your district’s budget is approved by public vote.  You cannot add funds to this account once it has been approved by the voters.  The public voted on a budget that said maintenance was going to spend $X dollars on equipment and if you exceeded that amount, you are basically going against what you told the public you would spend.  This is an area you will want to work with your Business Administrator on.  Be sure you plan ahead with what you need to buy, get prices and allow for price increases as there are months between the approval of the budget and the implementation of the budget.  Due to the circumstances described with budget approval, you are able to purchase equipment for an amount greater than $25,000 without repercussions.  You can use the 3 quote process, or you can use one of the other forms of acquiring equipment, such as a NYS Contract Price.</p><br>
				
			<h3>New York State Contract Purchasing</h3> <br>
				
			<p>New York State, through the Office of Government Services (OGS) allows vendors to submit offers of special discounts for schools, municipalities, parks and recreation, water authorities, and other state affiliates.  Awarded vendors are given a New York State Contract number for products they have on contract.  There is a very large number of vendors in the NYS Contract system.  You can buy tractors, cameras, furniture, carpeting, electrical supplies, plumbing supplies, paint, technology, and more.  There are contracts for labor as well.  So if you were going to buy a new 40 hp diesel tractor for your district, there will be a few vendors on state contract that you can contact and select the tractor you like best.  You are not locked into one brand for most items.  You issue a purchase order for the equipment you want and note the state contract number and provided quote and you are good to go.  However, if you are buying a product that is not on state contract or is brand that you feel is better than the one on state contract, you can utilize a Purchasing Network.  Below is a list of some frequently used contracts, which lists vendors who are part of this contract.  Please note that these contract awards can change, but most vendors tend to remain active on this list.</p><br>

			<h3>Purchasing Through BOCES</h3><br> 
				
				<h5>BOCES BID LISTS -</h5> <p>This service provides leadership and coordination for component school districts, municipalities and counties in cooperative bidding. Representatives of the school districts and agencies work with BOCES personnel to develop standard specifications for necessary items. BOCES then prepares proposals and bids, solicits vendors to bid, requests samples as needed and coordinates the analysis and decision making process for cooperative bids. Savings are generated not only from the millions of dollars saved, but also from the time saved by the individual participants.</p><br>
				
			<h5>BOCES Bids</h5><br>
 			<p>Every BOCES is a little different and is dependent on the makeup of components and the RIC associated with it. Each BOCES service offerings are in direct correspondence to the demographics and regional locations being served. The offerings of the BOCES under the Cooperative Purchasing CoSer will be directly dependent on the districts that utilize the services.  Bids being offered are often dictated by the request of the participating districts. Most bids offered by the BOCES will be because two or more Participants are interested in have the solicitation done.  This can be 2 districts or the BOCES &amp; a district.</p><br>
				
			<h5>General Outline of the steps in a BOCES bid:</h5>
				<ol>
			<li>Send Requisition Listing to Participants</li>
			<li>Participants Return Requisition Listing with their Requirements for Period indicated on the Bid. This would include anticipated quantities and any additional items that are not already outlined in the Requisition Listing.</li><br>
				
			<li>BOCES combines all requirements into one master bid listing that becomes the bid. list/specifications within the solicitation document.</li>
			<li>BOCES advertising the bid and may post the bid on a website where vendors can down loan the document directly from the site. Many entities use www.BidNetDirect.com</li>
			<li>Legal Ads are put in our official papers.</li>
			<li>BOCES receives the bids by the due date.</li>
			<li>BOCES reviews the bids received for responsiveness and prepares tabulation.</li>
			<li>Tabulation is reviewed with bid specification by the Bid Committee and the responsive &amp; responsible low bidder is then determined.</li>
			<li>Recommendation for award is prepared and sent to the WFL Board.</li>
			<li>Letters of award (&amp; non-award) are prepared for vendors.</li>
			<li>Letters are issued &amp;to Participants with award information.</li>
			<li>Contract information is posted to BOCES website.</li>
			<li>Award information is posted on the www.BidNetDirect.com website.</li>
		</ol><br>
	
<h5>Bid Participants Responsibilities for each bid:</h5>
				<ul>
				<li>Provide the BOCES with the quantities and items when requested.</li>
<li>If available, participate on the Bid Committee.  Committee will review the specs and the bids received.</li>
				<li>The Committee, which is comprised of the Participants and the Purchasing Staff, together make the recommendations that the BOCES Board will consider for award.</li>
<li>Once awarded if there are any issues that are not easily solved with the awarded vendor, contact the BOCES to help obtain a resolution.</li>
					</ul>
	
	
<h5>BOCES Responsibilities for each bid:</h5>
				<ul>
<li>Coordination of the Bid:  collect the quantities and compile into one master document that will be provided to the Bidders.</li>
					</ul><br>

<h3>Purchasing Networks</h3>
<p>Purchasing Networks are national contracts, not state wide like our NYS Contract.  There are a number of Purchasing Networks and over the years many have merged or acquired other networks.  Today the most popular networks are Omnia (was National IPA), KPN (Keystone Purchasing Network), and Sourcewell are ones that immediately come to mind. <strong>NOTE: Prior to using a Purchasing Network, make sure your Board of Education has a policy which allows this.</strong></p> 

<h3>Preferred Source</h3>
<p>This is a term you will see in the NYS purchasing guidelines.  The preferred souces are Corcraft, NYSPSP, and NYSID.  If you are able to purchase the product you need from one of these Preferred Sources, you should do so.  There are products from these sources that may fit into your inventory of items, but you are not going to find tractors, mowers, lighting, flooring, and such from these preferred sources.</p>
				
<h3>Sole Source</h3>
<p>This one is for a vendor who is the sole source for the product you wish to purchase and therefore you are unable to get competitive bids on the item.  For example, there is a company who manufactures an infield grooming machine for baseball fields and they sell this item direct, so there isn’t a distribution network for their product.  If you want to purchase this machine, you have to buy it direct from the manufacturer, so this would be a sole source product.  In this case, you justify why you need this product specifically and note it as sole source.<strong>NOTE: Prior to using a Purchasing Network, make sure your Board of Education has a policy which allows this.</strong></p>
				
<h3>Piggyback Contracts</h3>
				<p>In many cases, you can purchase products or services by utilizing a contract of a local municipality, county, or neighboring district(s).  For instance, if the county for your district has put out a bid for sidewalk replacement, you may be able to piggyback on their contract and use the same vendor at the same cost the county is paying.  It is never a bad idea to ask districts in your area if they have bid services or materials that can also utilized by your district. <strong>NOTE: Prior to using a Piggyback Contact, make sure your Board of Education has a policy which allows this.</strong> </p>
				
				
<h3>Local Purchases</h3>
<p>Purchasing locally can be a problem.  As much as we like to support our local businesses in our community, we must use caution when purchasing in this fashion.  More than likely, your local hardware store or sign shop is not a part of any type of purchasing contract.  Even though you will save money by driving only 5 minutes to the local hardware store versus 25 minutes to the big box store on contract, auditors will not like the local purchasing practice.  Use discretion and purchase minimally locally or use multiple quotes to justify these purchases.  Many auditors will say, “you could have ordered it as a NYS contract purchase and got the item the next day.  What was so important that you couldn’t go the correct way to purchase the item?”  We all do make these local purchases, so just be mindful of how much you buy and if you don’t need it today, you may want to buy it from a NYS Contract vendor.  Of course, small purchases within your purchasing policy can be made locally and you are encouraged to do business with local vendors.</p>

<h3>Schedule N Purchases</h3>
<p>The “Schedule N” Purchasing program is a State Funding mechanism offered thru the NYSED Office of Facilities Planning. The program, created from previous Safe Act legislation, focuses on giving school districts the ability to make on going improvements related to the School’s Physical Security Systems.</p> 

				<p>There are two main areas in which the Schedule N program covers: Video Surveillance and Door Hardening.</p> 
				<ul>
				
<li><strong>Video Surveillance:</strong> A district can purchase and be reimbursed up to a total of $35,000 a year of video cameras. The cost per camera cannot exceed $2000. The cost may include the camera, the installation, and the cable for the camera. This does not include any software or server costs associated with the camera. The purchase must be completed and paid for by the end of their fiscal year, June 30th. The district will then submit the Schedule N form and receive reimbursement at some point in the next fiscal year. However, the reimbursement is not at the full amount, it will be at the district’s capital building aide rate just like a capital or capital outlay project. Example, if a district spends $35,000 and their building aide rate is 80%, they will receive $28,000 in reimbursement. Note: The Video Program does not require a Building permit approved by the Office of Facilities.   Also note that you cannot exceed $35,000 in camera expenses on your form.  In other words, you can’t spent $38,000 on 20 cameras and then submit the form thinking you will get back $35,000.  You claim will be rejected by the state and you will receive no aid if you are to do this.  If you need to spend more than $35,000 on cameras that you wish to get aid on, you must do it through an approved SED project.</li>
					
<li><strong>Door Hardening:</strong> The door hardening program is meant to make it more difficult for an intruder to enter a space through any said door. NYSED will reimburse a district for: the physical door, door frame, windows, door hardware, and the associated electronics to unlock the door ( card reader, strike, power, door contact). Intercoms and door release can also be funded. The door hardening program does not have a total dollar amount limit per year as the video program does. However, it has a type of door limit. The tiers are as follows:</li>
					<ul>
					
<li>A District Building Main Entrance (usually 2-3 allowed per building) - $10,000 per door.</li> 
<li>Any Exterior Door - $5,000 per door.</li> 
<li>Any Interior Door - $1,000 per door.</li>
						</ul>

<p>The reimbursement for the door program is the same as the video program above with one exception. The program also does not require a building permit, but the district’s architect of record does need to review the door work defined on the form and provide their professional license on the form.</p>
				
<p>Included in this section are three documents: A comprehensive document that outlines the above programs in detail, the actual Safe Act legislative narrative, the Schedule N reimbursement form.  <strong> NOTE: These purchases must be part of your district's safety plan.</strong></p> 





<h3>New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act ( NYSAFE):</h3> 
<h5>IMPACT ON SCHOOL DISTRICT BUILDING AID</h5>
				<ol>
<li>The NYSAFE Act enhances NYSEL 3602 6-c aid for the purchase of stationary metal detectors, security cameras and safety devices for electrically operated partitions. BOCES are not eligible for this aid.</li>

<li>The NYSAFE Act changes the existing provisions of NYSEL 3602 6-c in three ways:</li>
					<ol type="A">
<li>In addition to the devices specifically mentioned in the original statute, expenses for electronic security systems and hardened doors approved by the Commissioner on or after July 1, 2013 are now eligible for this aid.</li>
				
<li>All eligible expenses for this aid, not just the additional devices mentioned above, will now be aided at the current year RWADA aid ratio plus 10%; however, the aid ratio enhancement applies only to eligible expenses incurred during the 2012-13 through 2022-23 school years. Note: The RWADA aid ratio is not necessarily the same as the selected aid ratio for Building Aid; the annual calculation of all ratios can be viewed on the Building Summary Aid Report (BLD-SBA)</li>
				
<li>The purchase of electronic security systems and / or hardened doors must be included in the school district’s school safety plan.</li>
						</ol>
				
<li>The NYSAFE Act  impacts only State Aid for security cameras, etc. as provided under NYSEL 3602 (6-c). It has no impact on regular building projects aided via assumed amortization (NYSEL 3602 (6)(e)); i.e., expenses for security cameras, metal detectors, electronic security systems and hardened doors are not eligible for the new NYSAFE 10% enhanced RWADA Aid ratio if they are included in capital projects subject to the regular Office of Facilities Planning review process and aided under assumed amortization.</li>
				
<li>Reporting: Districts will continue to claim base year expense for all items eligible for this aid on SAMS Form FB Schedule N, and SED State Aid Office approval of SAMS Form FB will constitute ‘Commissioner’s approval’ of aidable base year expense. Starting with 2012-13 expense reported in 2013-14 SAMS, Schedule N will contain one or more new sections for reporting base year expense for electronic security systems and hardened doors. The new sections will include an item requiring the district to note whether the purchased electronic security systems and/or hardened doors are included in the school district’s safety plan. If a district indicates that the items are included in the safety plan, the overall SAMS certification by the superintendent will be considered legal certification of this assertion.</li>
				
<li>Cost Allowance and System Scope: As required by law, the Office of Facilities Planning will prescribe  maximum cost allowances for electronic security systems and hardened doors which will be published when available and displayed on Schedule N on 2013-14 SAMS. Although the cost allowances have not yet been set, please note the following regarding this aid:   The purpose of this statute, including the NYSAFE amendments, is to allow a school district to purchase and install security systems and devices separate from traditional capital construction projects and in student-occupied buildings. It is not intended as a method to allow installation of comprehensive security systems which would otherwise be subject to the standard building permit review process at the Office of Facilities Planning. Districts are advised not to purchase/install security systems of a cost/scope that could possibly be subject to the standard review process with the expectation that the expense could be claimed for aid under this statute. If a claim for an installation is rejected by the State Aid Office for exceeding the cost allowance under SAMS Schedule N process, it will also be rejected by Facilities Planning because it was completed prior to the issuance of a building permit. In this situation it is possible no aid will be paid for the installed system.</li>
			</ol><br>	
				
<p>The Office of Facilities Planning has published guidance on eligible expenses and cost allowances: <a href="http://www.p12.nysed.gov/facplan/documents/NYSAFEActImplementation.pdf" title="NYSAFE ACT GUIDANCE" target="new">http://www.p12.nysed.gov/facplan/documents/NYSAFEActImplementation.pdf</a><br>
All specific purchase/construction questions, and questions on eligibility of specific equipment, may be directed to the Office of Facilities Planning (518-474-3906).<br> 
All other questions regarding the new provision in the NYSAFE Act may be directed to the State Aid Office (518-474-2977).<br>

		<div class="topic-header">HVAC FILTERS</div>
			
		  <div class="text-content"><h3>Filtration 101 for Schools</h3><p>The HVAC industry (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) is a multibillion-dollar global industry employing hundreds of thousands and has a presence in virtually every building.  Each letter in HVAC represents a separate industry requiring a wide range of engineering disciplines to develop and manufacture the products demanded today. 	</p><br>
				
			<h3>The Air Filter</h3>
				
			<p>Within an HVAC system, the V stands for ventilation which in this context, can be defined as the process of supplying or removing air by use of a fan, from a space for the purpose of conditioning the air to control temperature, humidity, or pressure for example.  Filtration in this context can be thought of as the process of removing particles from that air and the air filter is the specific device that removes those particles. 
				</p><br>
			<p>The air filter is a single component in a much larger and more complex HVAC system. However, since all the ventilated air is intended to flow through the air filter, it can affect the entire system and thus the occupants within the building. Because of this, the air filter is a critical component and must be selected to optimize the HVAC system’s design criteria. In order to do so, it is helpful to understand the three main performance attributes of an air filter and how they work together.
				</p><br>
			<p>An air filter should remove the percentage of specific particles sizes according to its rated value (particle capture efficiency) while not restricting airflow through the filter and into the space (resistance to airflow) and should perform those two functions while holding the dirt collected within the body of the filter for a reasonable service life to reduce maintenance expenses (dirt holding capacity).  
				</p><br>
			<p>Each of the three performance attributes works in conjunction with the others. When constructed properly, the best air filter performs in the intersection of all three and delivers optimum performance: high particle capture efficiency with a low average resistance to airflow with a reasonably long service life. 
				</p><br>
				<h3>Particle Capture Efficiency MERV Value</h3>
				<img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/camfil-1.jpg" width="300"><br>
				
			<p>Particle capture efficiency is the effectiveness of the air filter in removing particles. There are two major rating systems commonly used today. MERV (Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value) is contained within ASHRAE Standard 52.2 and ISO16890 is a filter test standard created by the International Organizations for Standardization.  
				</p><br>
				<p>ASHRAE Standard 52.2- 2017, Method of Testing General Ventilation Air-Cleaning Devices for Removal Efficiency by Particle Size, is currently the dominant test standard in North America and provides guidance on how to test a specific air filter and award it a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV). This value is then used to apply a specific MERV level to a filter based on the level of protection the application or facility requires as recommended by cognizant authorities. Particles are grouped into three size ranges, 0.3 microns to 1, 1 to 3.0 microns, and 3.0 to 10 microns. A MERV value is assigned based on the filter’s ability to capture a certain percentage of particles in each size range. 				
				</p><br>
				
				<p>ISO 16890  Air Filters for General Ventilation is an international test standard that replaced EN779 in July 2018. This test standard classifies air filters based on the removal efficiency of particulate matter (PM) for three size ranges; PM1, PM2.5 and PM10. ISO16890 assigns a value to a filter based on particle capture within one PM range. Unlike ASHRAE 52.2, the ISO standard incorporates a conditioning step procedure to account for the benefit of a temporary electrostatic charge which can inflate a filter’s particle capture efficiency performance. 
				</p><br>
				<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ASHRAE Epidemic Task Force provided the HVAC industry with core recommendations for schools and universities. Many state and local officials adopted or refer to these for basic guidelines regarding air filtration. These recommendations call for a minimum filtration efficiency of MERV 13. The ISO16890 equivalent of MERV 13 is ePM1 -50%.  See the comparison chart below. 
				</p>
				
				<p>HVAC systems can be configured with a single air filter stage while others can have multiple stages of air filtration. If the HVAC unit is a single-stage type, that air filter should be a minimum of MERV 13. If the unit has multiple stages, the final stage should be a minimum MERV 13 while the prefiltration in those units can be less than MERV 13.				
				</p>
				<p>Note: Particle capture efficiencies, (MERV values), are not additive. A MERV 5 filter followed by a MERV 8 filter does not equal the same performance as a single MERV 13 filter. </p><br>
				
			  <h3>MERV versus MERV-A </h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>  <img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/camfil-2.jpg" width="700" height="710" alt="">	
			  <br>
				<p>A filter’s MERV value is important because the user can refer to the MERV chart and see the percentage of particles within each size range the filter is rated to remove. Since a higher MERV generally comes with a higher pressure drop, filter manufacturers have developed techniques to achieve higher MERV, but with lower pressure drops. To do this, electrostatically charged filter media is used. There are positive and negative attributes with this type of air filter.</p><br>
			  
			  <p>It’s helpful to understand how a typical N95-style face mask works and how this relates to electrostatically charged air filters. The 95 in N95 stands for 95% particle capture efficiency and in this case, on 0.3-micron particles. That’s a very high particle capture efficiency; slightly higher than a MERV 16 air filter. However, while you can breathe relatively easily through an N95 mask, the same mask made from MERV 16 filter media would be very difficult to breathe through because the airflow resistance (pressure drop) would be very high. </p><br>
			  
<p>An N95 mask accomplishes high particle capture efficiency with low airflow resistance by relying on a thin layer of fabric with a very low resistance to airflow. This fabric layer also carries an electrostatic charge, creating what’s known as an electret. This charge attracts particles out of the airstream onto the fibers (much like how a magnet attracts metal) and the charge holds them in place. The high particle capture efficiency with low resistance is an ideal solution for respiratory face masks, but the technology faces challenges when used on air filters. </p><br>
			  
<p>An N95 respiratory mask is designed for limited use and the volume of air we breathe is much smaller than the amount of air an HVAC system moves during a typical day. As large volumes of air move through the electrostatically charged filter, the ultra-fine accumulating dirt particles begin to insulate the charge from attracting dirt particles. As this process builds, more and more dirt particles slip past until eventually, the charge is adding no value to the particle capture efficiency performance. The MERV value of this filter falls. The ASHRAE 52.2 committee is aware of this loss in efficiency phenomenon and created a supplementary test procedure to MERV known as Appendix J. This test procedure removes the benefit of any charge on a filter and delivers a MERV value without it. This gives a more realistic view of how the air filter will perform in a real-world setting after a period of time has passed and its charge is no longer effective. </p><br>
			  
<p>This is known as the MERV-A value. </p><br>
			 <h3>Airflow Resistance Pressure Drop</h3><br>
			  <img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/camfil-3.png" width="300">
			  <p>All air filters present a measurable amount of resistance to airflow. As air weaves through the fibers of the filter media, the buildup of air increases the pressure upstream of the filter compared to the downstream side. This is commonly referred to as pressure drop and is measured in inches of water gauge, abbreviated as " w.g. 
			  </p>
			  <p>Specifications provided by air filter manufacturers should list the initial pressure drop when the filter is brand new at a standardized volume of airflow. All filters tested according to ASHRAE 52.2 and labeled with a MERV value are tested at 2000 cfm (cubic feet per minute) or 500 fpm (feet per minute) on a 24” high by 24” wide air filter.</p>
			  
			  <p>As dirt loads on the filter, pressure drop increases, less conditioned air is flowing into the space, and the desired comfort level of the room is not maintained. The length of time for this to occur varies based on the performance attributes of the air filter, the volume of airflow, and the cleanliness of the source air. </p>
			  
			  <p>When airflow is restricted, there are two possible responses based on the controls within the HVAC system. </p>
			  
			  <p>If the unit is equipped with a variable frequency drive fan (VFD) and set to adjust fan speed based on pressure drop, the fan will speed up to restore the proper airflow. At each interval when the fan speed increases, energy cost likewise increases. At some point, the pressure drop has increased to the point where the fan can no longer maintain proper airflow and the filter should be changed. </p>
			  
			  <p>On systems with a constant-speed fan and no way to increase the fan speed, the airflow into the room will gradually decrease as resistance increases. At some point, this filter will need to be replaced to restore the proper airflow. </p>
			  
			  <p>A widely used rule of thumb for both systems is to change the filter when the initial pressure drop doubles. This is not an absolute rule but is helpful to use as a starting point to determine when to change the air filters in each system. The rationale behind this is the cost and performance drop-off associated with a pressure drop that has doubled is more expensive than the cost to change the filter. </p>
			  
				<h3>Dirt Holding Capacity &#40;DHC&#41;</h3><br>
			  <img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/camfil-3.png" width="300"><br>
			  <p>The third performance attribute relates to service-life. Air filters capture dirt from the air as it passes through, but the filter must also hold that dirt and prevent it from working loose and continuing downstream. The amount of dirt the filter can hold directly affects how long the filter can be left in service. Changing air filters can be an expensive and time-consuming task for any maintenance department. Not only does it incur a direct expense, but it also prevents or delays workers from doing other important projects which may have significant cost-saving benefits to the facility. If the facility hires outside vendors for filter changeouts, that can often be a major expense depending on the size of the facility or campus. </p>
			  
			  <p>Dirt holding capacity is a product of particle capture efficiency. A filter that is more efficient at capturing dirt is going to add more dirt to the filter over the same amount of time. But the limit for how much dirt a filter can hold is based in part on airflow resistance. As dirt accumulates in the filter, airflow is restricted and eventually reaches a point at which it must be changed. </p>
			  
			  <p>Generally speaking, air filters with greater filter media area can hold a larger amount of dirt which increases their service life. A 24” x 24” x 2” high-capacity, high-quality two-inch MERV 8 pleated panel filter with 17 sq feet of filter media area can hold 175 grams of dirt when tested under ASHRAE 52.2 test procedures. However, a 24” x 24” x 12” high-capacity MERV 14 V-bank style filter with almost 200 sq ft of filter media can hold over 475 grams. </p>
			  
			  <p>The optimum air filter for each application is one that captures an acceptable amount of unwanted particle sizes, (particle capture efficiency) holds that dirt within the body of the filter for a reasonable length of time (dirt holding capacity), and performs those two functions while still flowing the required volume of clean air into the occupied space (resistance to airflow). </p>
			  
			    <img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/camfil-4.jpg" width="300"><br>
			  <p>The ideal filter; high capture efficiency, high dirt holding capacity with low resistance to airflow.</p><br>
			  
			  <h3>How to Identify Optimum Air Filters for Each Application</h3>
			  
			  <p>It’s first helpful to recognize the four basic styles of air filters; panel filters; box style, pocket (bag) filters, and V-bank style. </p><br>
			  <h4>1. Panel Filter</h4><br>
			  <p class="paragraph"><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/camfil-7.jpg" width:300px><span class="Ptext">Carboard-framed, pleated media panel filters are the most common air filter. They come in a wide variety of heights and widths and are typically available in depths of one, two, or four inches. MERV values are in the low to medium range; from MERV 7 to MERV 13. These can be used as the only filter in single-stage HVAC systems or as prefilters in multi-stage systems. Pressure drops can range from a low of 0.20” w.g., up to 0.70” for MERV 13 models. Service life varies tremendously based on the quality of the filter. Economy versions can range from monthly changeouts in high dirt load conditions but are often set up on quarterly changeouts for more typical applications. There are versions of pleated panel filters available with extended service lives from nine to twelve months. There are metal panel filters that are designed to be washed and reused, but these are best suited for industrial applications. Pleated panel filters can also use a filter media containing activated carbon to help control odor, gases, and certain VOCs (volatile organic compounds) in addition to dirt particles. </span></p>

				<div class="text-content">
					<h3>BLEACHER INSPECTION</h3><br>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px;" class="doctext">The bleachers in your facilities are to be inspected annually to insure the safety of your students, faculty, and spectators. The person performing the inspection should be qualified to do so and must document the details of the inspection process. Having your permanent bleachers be a part of your BCS is definitely a good idea, as repairs or replacement of permanent bleachers can be extensive. </p>
					
    				<p>There are three types of bleachers typically found at most schools which must be inspected: Permanent, Portable, and telescopic. Portable bleachers are those usually around your baseball and softball fields.  These are usually bleachers that can be relocated if necessary.  Permanent bleachers are those anchored to the ground like those around your football or soccer fields.  Telescopic bleachers are found indoors in your gymnasium and pool areas. These bleachers can be extended outward when used either manually or by some type of powered motor. Bleachers should have non-skid surfaces in the walk areas to reduce the chance of a slip and fall.  Some bleachers 
    				are extened and retracted by hand, while others have a motorized system to move them. The wheels on the bottom of your bleachers need to be clean and rotate freely. A wheel not operating in the proper manner can damage the finish or wood on your gymnasium floor.  You should do regular checks on your bleachers to be sure the wheels are not damaging your gymnasium floor.  Bleacher inspections should also look for any loose or worn parts, missing fasteners, or broken pieces that could cause injury. 
  					</p>
					<h4>Inspection of Telescopic Bleacher:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Columns, cantilever arms, caster horns, wheel pins, tier catches (row locks), guide rods, upper and lower guides, stop pins, lift angles, floor and wall attachments, wall bucks and all frame weldments.</li>
						<li>Deck nosing, riser beams, end caps, deck supports and deck support wheels, section connectors, diagonal bracing, cross and  tension bracing, brace connections, frame connections, outrigger, hinges, truncation supports (if applicable), handles, end panels, warning plates, chairs/bench seating, seat supports, seat boards and riser boards.</li>
						<li>Transition and intermediate steps, step hinges; step end caps, rubber pads, step lighting, step connections and safety walk tape.</li>
						<li>End Rails, front rails, rear rails, aisle step rails, rail socket attachments, hardware (set screws), socket and railing weldments.</li>
						<li>Wiring and wire harness, disconnects, contactors, fuses, circuit breakers, receptacles, plug adapters, aisle lights and wiring, transformers, limit switches, delay switches, relay boxes, junction boxes, pendant control cord and receptacle box.</li>
						<li>Power Frame System: Motor and gearbox, bearings, roller chain, master links, drive wheels, drive shafts, weights, torque tubes, spacer plates, torsion springs, mounting brackets, motor alignment and weight adjustments.</li>
						<li>Engineered to order or (ETO) products related to jobs based upon the required operational usage specified by Owner, but not limited to items such as; end curtains, end panels, hydraulic assist dollies, forklift assist systems, Air compressed lifting systems, floor pins and program supports.</li><br>
				</ul>
					<h4>Inspection of Outdoor Bleachers</h4>
					<p>Just like indoor bleachers, your outdoor bleachers should be inspected annually. 
    				<ul>
        				<li>Make sure bleachers are level and stable.</li>
        				<li>Bleachers should not wobble when you walk on them.</li>
        				<li>Inspect bleacher structure for signs of rust or rot.</li>
        				<li>Check for broken welds.</li>
        				<li>Inspect for loose or missing fasteners.</li>
        				<li>Check for damaged or missing cross member braces.</li>
        				<li>Check guardrails for missing or loose fasteners.</li>
        				<li>Be sure guardrails/handrails are ridgid and not moved easily.</li>
        				<li>Check seating and foot boards for missing or loose fasteners.</li>
        				<li>Inspect for broken, splintered, or cracked seating and foot boards.</li>
        				<li>Verify that seating and foot boards are not warped.</li>
        				<li>Check for any tripping hazards.</li>

        <p>Each year, approximately 220,000 people die from Sudden Cardiac Arrest.  The vast majority of these deaths are caused by the initiation of an abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation (VF), a chaotic heart rhythm that results in loss of circulation and oxygen delivery to body tissues.  The only effective treatment to reverse VF to a normal heart rhythm is defibrillation (electric shock to the heart).  However, defibrillation must be provided early or irreversible brain damage can occur within 10 minutes.  It is now possible for lay people who have taken a short course in CPR and the use of an AED to provide defibrillation.</p>

		<div class="topic-header">CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS</div>
			<div class="text-content">
				<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Carbon Monoxide Detector requirements became a requirement starting in 2015.  The full SED document on CO Detectors can be found <a href="https://p12.nysed.gov/facplan/documents/CarbonMonoxideGuidelines.pdf" title="NYSED CO Detector Document" target="new" color="red">HERE</a>  
				There are two types of systems that may be used to detect carbon monoxide and sound an alarm. They are self- contained (residential style) carbon monoxide alarms, and carbon monoxide detection systems. The use of either type of system or both types of systems, within a building in accordance with regulations is permissible. A school district/BOCES would need to determine for itself which system (or systems) is best to be used in each of their buildings.  The carbon monoxide systems can be a part of your fire alarm system, where the devices are wired into your fire alarm panel and are monitored just like your smoke heads.  The carbon monoxide system can also be a stand alone system with all the detectors wired to a central control panel that is monitored.</p>

				<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Education (school) buildings will require the detection of carbon monoxide in the following areas under the new regulations: all classrooms that contain devices that may emit products of combustion, such as science lab with gas burners; all classrooms adjacent to garages; areas served by fuel fired heating/ventilating and makeup air units; areas served by heating/ventilating units that pull air from spaces that contain equipment or systems that may emit products of combustion; and non-classroom area(s) that contain devices that may emit products of combustion.
				</p><p>
				<h4>ALARMS WILL BE PLACED IN:</h4></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Every classroom containing a carbon monoxide source in the space (See guidelines for examples);</li>
					<li>Every classroom adjacent to a garage (or area that has an overhead door).</li>
					<li>Every non-classroom space containing a carbon monoxide source in the space (Alarm generally to be placed between the source equipment and the door (or other opening) providing access between the space and other areas of the building).  Such rooms would be the kitchen and boiler room.</li>
					<li>Outside every non-classroom space containing a carbon monoxide source in the space at a location that maximizes detection of and notification of the building occupants.</li>
					<li>Either all spaces served by a carbon monoxide-producing heating/ventilating/air conditioning (HVAC) system (See definition in guidelines.); or alternately two interconnected alarms (one in the first space   served by the carbon monoxide-producing HVAC system, and the second located in an approved location). If two interconnected alarms are used, the approved location may be the corridor in the vicinity of the area served by the HVAC system, or a main office area. The intent is to locate the second alarm in an area that would result in the fastest notification of the occupants.</li>
					<li>Rooms adjacent to the boiler room and outside the entrance doors to the kitchen and boiler room.</li>
				</ul>

<!--EMERGENCY EXIT SIGNS AND LIGHTS STARTS HERE-->	
			<div id="section-exitsigns" class="tab-content">
				<div class="topic-header">EMERGENCY EXIT SIGNS AND EMERGENCY LIGHTS</div>
					<div class="text-content">
						<p><section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/exitsign-1.jpg" class="smallImg" alt="Illuminated Exit Sign"/></section>Emergency Exit Signs and Emergency Lights are tested monthly.  There are several types of exit signs that can be used in your school.  There are those that include emergency lights, those that are just an exit sign, and some that are non-powered exit signs.  You may also have standalone emergency lights that are not a part of an exit sign.  Non-powered signs can be used in storage buildings that do not have electrical power.  Many times, during capital project work, new exit signs and emergency lights will be added to your facility. We suggest you request the new units be the same ones you currently have in your facility.  It is much easier to train staff to test one type of sign/light and to also keep batteries and bulbs for one model.  Many schools over the years end up with signs and lights which were made by a slew of  manufacturers.  If possible, try to avoid that situation.  Label your exit signs and emergency lights so you can create a workorder that will document that you tested each of these units.  <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/exitsign-2.jpg" class="smallImg" alt="Illuminated Exit Sign"/></section> Number them in logical order so staff inspecting them can start at 1 and then reasonably follow a path to get to each sign/light in numerical order.  Some maintenance software programs can create a map for you which will detail the location of each of these items.  This will make doing this monthly check very easy on your staff, especially if you do not have the same person always doing the check, or if you are introducing new staff to this inspection.</p>
        
        				<p>Exit signs stay on all the time and many of them have two sets of bulbs. One set of bulbs operates on building power, and the other set, which comes on only when there is a power failure, are low voltage bulbs that operate on battery power. Therefore, an exit sign that appears to be working normally may not work at all during a power failure, because the low voltage bulbs have burned out or the battery is faulty. <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/exitsign-3.jpg" class="smallImg" alt="Illuminated Exit Sign"/></section>Most emergency lights and exit signs have a small “push to test” button somewhere on the frame of the device.  You can push the button, or you may have to hold this button for a period of time to test the bulbs and battery, depending on the brand of the sign/light.  If the lights dim right away, or some of the bulbs do not work, then you should have your maintenance staff make repairs to the unit.  You should test the units to be sure they are illuminated for a 30 second period.  Reference the instructions provided by the device manufacturer.</p>
        
        
        				<h3>Frequency:  Emergency Exit Signs and Emergency Lights are to be tested once per month and annually.</h3><br>
        
        				<h3>Testing Procedure</h3>

        				<ul>
            				<li>Check to see if the sign is currently illuminated, if not check the bulb.</li>
            				<li>Check to see if there are any trouble codes flashing (some units will flash an LED if the device is in fault).  If so, correct the fault.</li>
            				<li>Press or hold the test button per the manufacturer’s directions and verify the exit sign is illuminated in test mode and that the emergency lights have come on if they are present.</li>
            				<li>Press or hold the test button for the emergency lights and verify they are working.</li>
							<li>An annual test is also required, with the lights being operated on emergency power for the full minimum of thirty minutes. The best time to perform this test is during your emergency generator test.</li>
            				<li>Document test results.</li>  
            				<li>You must keep inspection records for 3 years.</li>

<!-- EYEWASH STATIONS STARTS HERE -->	
			<div id="section-eyewash" class="tab-content">
				<div class="topic-header">EYEWASH STATIONS AND EMERGENCY SHOWERS</div>
					<div class="text-content">
						<section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/gravity eyewash.jpg" class="medImg" alt="Gravity Eyewash Station"/></section>
						Eyewash stations are to be tested monthly and these inspections should be documents.  You can document the inspection in your maintenance software, or you can use inspection tags that are placed on the showers and eyewash stations.  There are 2 general types of eyewash stations and those are ones that are plumbed directly to a water supply line, and those that have a water reservoir (gravity fed). <br><br>
						Gravity fed eyewash stations are filled with water and must also have an eyewash preservative added to the water.  Typically the preservative will for 6 months, meaning that you must change the water every 6 months and add new preservative to the water. These gravity fed units vary is the amount of water they can hold.  Flow rates will vary by the size and manufacturer of the station, but typically these have flow rates of 1/2 gallon per minute.  If you are purchasing a portable station, be sure it can provide the suggested amount of water for flushing eyes that is recommended by the manufacturer of the chemicals in that area.  For example, if you are placing this in an area where you store field paint and field chalk, check the SDS sheets for each product and find the recommended flush time for eyes.  Use the figure that is the highest to appropriately size your gravity fed eyewash station.  Eyewash stations should have water in them no colder than 60 degrees. Part of the inspection process is to wipe down the unit to be sure it is clean and there are no obstructions that prevent access to the station, much like an electrical panel.<br><br><br>
		
						<strong>PLUMBED EYEWASH STATION</strong><br><br>
						<section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/eyewash fountain.jpg" class="medImg" alt="Eyewash Fountain"/></section>These eyewash stations are plumbed to your water supply and in many cases are tied to a water tempering valve so the user is flushing with warm water.  These are inspected monthly and the test method is rather straightforward.  The water being discharged can not travel more than 8 inches in height.  Bradley Wash Fountain makes a test gauges (Bradley part number 269-1444) that also has instructions for testing on the card.  This card is used to be sure sufficient water volume is being discharged and it also has a ruler so you can measure the height of the water discharge.  There are 2 parallel lines within the target circles and that area needs to be covered with water when you put the test card down into the water stream.  The test cards are a great tool as they also are a way to demonstrate that you tested the eyewash station in an scientific manner and not just by appearance.  The flaps on your eyewash station should open without any assistance when you turn on the eyewash station and they should also close on their own when you turn the station off.  If your station has a mixing valve, verify the water temperature is acceptable and should be a minimum of 60 degrees.   The eyewash is designed to operate so you can free both hands to force open your eyes so they can be properly flushed.  Always document your test results.  You should number all your eyewash stations and showers to provide better record keeping, which also helps those performing the tests to be sure they are testing each unit.<br><br><br>
						<strong>EMERGENCY SHOWERS</strong><br><br>
						<section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/emergency shower.jpg" class="img1" alt=""/></section>
						A great piece of advice.  Before you test any emergency shower, be sure you understand how your shower works.  Some older showers have a storage tank that dumps all the water out of the tank once the handle is pulled to activate the shower.  If you have that type of shower, you better have a drum under the shower head to capture the water.  Others will engage and disengage by the handle.  If you don’t have a floor drain under the shower, but sure you have something to capture the water.  The best tool to use is the shower sock and bucket.    This eliminates the water from splashing everywhere and allows you to flush 5 gallons of water out of the system to keep the water fresh in the pipes.  The handle should stay in the open position when you pull it as the shower is designed to allow you to activate the shower and then have both hands free.<br><br>

		<p>Handheld fire extinguishers are to be inspected when they are first installed and then once per month.  If the extinguishers are stored in an area where they are susceptible to rust, impact, or tampering, then you should inspect those extinguishers more often.  There are several types of fire extinguishers and the most common for schools are the ABC type, which are a dry chemical type of extinguisher.  The other type is the K type, which is common for kitchen areas.  It is strongly recommended to have your fire extinguishers identified and if possible, create a map showing the location of each of your extinguishers.  This will greatly assist your staff when doing their monthly inspections to be sure each extinguisher was checked.  You should also keep either a spreadsheet or put information in your CMMS that indicates when additional inspections are due for your extinguishers such as the 6- year internal inspection and the 12-year hydrostatic test.  When you perform the first monthly check after your fire extinguisher service company has done their annual inspections, you should use the list you created to verify all necessary tests were performed on each extinguisher and that the new inspection tags have been added.  See the example below.</p>

		<h3>Dry Chemical Extinguishers</h3>

			<p>You are expected to check your fire extinguishers monthly and each extinguisher should have an inspection tag attached that is signed and dated by the person doing the inspection.  The inspection process is simple, and these are the steps taken to perform this task.</p>
		<ol>
    		<li>The fire extinguisher should be accessible, unobstructed and marked so it clearly visible.</li>
    		<li>The fire extinguisher should be in its proper location.</li>
    		<li>The pressure gauge on the extinguisher should read in the green (operable range).  If not, you should need to have the extinguisher serviced.</li>
    		<li>Lift the fire extinguisher to verify it is in fact full.</li>
    		<li>Verify that the locking pin is in place and the tamper seal/strap is intact.</li>
    		<li>For wheeled extinguishers, make sure the condition of the tires, wheels, carriage, hose, and nozzle are acceptable.</li>
    		<li>For non-rechargeable extinguishers, operate the push-to-test pressure indicators.</li>
    		<li>Initial and date the tag.</li>

				<div class="topic-header">GENERATORS</div>
					<div class="text-content">
						
						<p>Emergency power generators must be maintained and tested regularly.  Generator codes fall under NEC70 and NFPA 110, with some overlap between the two of them.  There are some aspects of the required maintenance that you may have your staff perform on the generator (oil changes, filter replacement, etc.).  It is important that any Preventative Maintenance performed on the generator be documented and kept in your files.  NFPA code requires generators to be run for at least 30 minutes one per month.  Most generators have the capability to be automatically set to “exercise” once per month on a specific day and time.  For instance, you can have your generators run from 6:30am until 7:00 am on the first Monday of each month.</p>  <br>
        				<p>Learn what your generators will power.  Not all school buildings are equipped with generators and not all generators are sized to handle the full electrical requirements of the facility.  In many cases, the generators will only supply power to life safety devices, heating systems, network servers, kitchen coolers and refrigerators, and of course lighting.  Make sure you know what will not work when you lose power.  If you have or will be doing a capital project that impacts the electrical system or any critical components, be sure these items are incorporated into your emergency power grid.  You need to determine if your emergency power system will handle the new load that needs to be added to your system.</p><br>
        				<p>Complete documentation of all inspections, maintenance and testing must be maintained at the facility. NFPA 110 can be referenced for the complete and detailed requirements.</p><br>
        				<p>Copies of the NFPA materials, including the 2012 LSC (NFPA 101), the 2012 HCFC (NFPA 99), and the 2010 Standard for Emergency and Standby Power Systems (NFPA 110) can be obtained from the National Fire Protection Association, 1 Batterymarch Park, Quincy, Massachusetts, 02169, or through the NFPA website.</p>
        
        				<ul>
            				<li>Before getting into the generator inspection, it is good to know how your emergency power should operate should you have a power failure.</li>  
        					<li>Generators installed after 1974 must be able to supply power for at least 90 minutes.  Those in 1974 and prior, must run for 60 minutes.</li>
        					<li>For systems installed after 1974, an emergency light should activate within 10 seconds of a power loss.</li>
        					<li>Emergency lights should be arranged so that a space will not be in total darkness.</li>
        					<li>All areas of assembly with 100 or more occupants must have emergency lighting.</li>
        					<li>Areas of assembly constructed after 1984 with occupancy of 50 or more requires emergency lighting, along with other areas required by code.  Areas of assembly include swimming pools, gymnasiums, auditoriums, cafeterias, large group instructional rooms, and so on.</li>

				<p>Most districts have one or more playground facilities on their property for the use by their students and in most cases, by the community as well.  Playgrounds can provide an environment for injury if the area and equipment are not properly maintained and inspected.  If your playground area is to be safe for those using the equipment, it is imperative your staff understand what to look for when inspecting the equipment.  If possible, get your staff training by either your insurance carrier or the equipment manufacturer.  Having staff properly trained on what to look for during the inspection process is chief in lowering the risk of injury.  It is not just he equipment that we must be conscious of, but the ground surface as well.  The ground surface provides fall protection for those using the playground.  Signage is also important.  Here is a link to the <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/325.pdf" target="new">Pubic Playground Safety Handbook</a>, which will give you all the information you will need to develop an inspection procedure.  Here is the link for a <a href="../NewHandbookGrid/documents/Playground Inspection Checklist Sample.docx.pdf" title="Playground Checklist" target="_blank">checklist for your inspections</a>.

				<div class="topic-header">INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT &amp; NEIGHBOR NOTIFICATION</div>
					<div class="text-content">
						
						

<h3>Indoor Pest Management</h3>
<p>Pest Management is a requirement and an important part of keeping staff and students safe and healthy.  NYSED Facilities Planning has a section on Pest Management and we are going to paraphrase their document, which is 11 pages long. You may have someone on your staff who is registered with the DEC to apply pesticides, or you may be like most districts and hire a licensed professional to handle your pest management needs.  The short version is you can only apply pesticides in or around your school if you are licensed by the DEC and you follow the 48-hour advance notification requirements of the Pesticide Neighbor Notification Law.  Spraying pesticides near playgrounds and sports fields requires and emergency situation and the approval of your school board.  This is detailed below. </p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
				
<p>The development and implementation of an integrated pest management (IPM) program is the key in achieving pesticide use reduction, while providing effective and economical pest control. The Board of Regents amended Part 155 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education and now requires the establishment of a least-toxic approach to IPM (§155.4(d)(2)).  Pesticides should only be considered as a last resort when other methods have proven unsuccessful. Even then, only the least toxic and pest-specific pesticides should be used. Any public or nonpublic elementary or secondary school that decides to use a pesticide product as a last resort in addressing a pest problem, must comply with the Neighbor Notification Law (section 409-h of the Education Law) -see page 10 of this guide.</p><br>
						
<h4>WHAT IS IPM (Integrated Pest Management)?</h4>
<p>IPM is a process for managing, preventing, and suppressing pests with minimal impact on human health, the environment, and nontarget organisms. </p>
<p>IPM's goal is to create an inhospitable and an unfavorable environment for pests by removing their food and shelter, and by restricting their access into building structures. Good housekeeping is the cornerstone for this process. </p>
<p>Pesticide applications may only be performed by individuals currently certified by the DEC as pesticide applicators or by a certified pesticide technician or an apprentice working under the direct on-site supervision of a certified applicator pursuant. It is illegal for individuals other than those noted above to apply any pesticide products in a school building or on school grounds. If a school determines that pesticides should be applied, it is strongly recommended that schools only employ mature individuals (over 21) to apply pesticide products in schools and on school grounds. In addition, the 48-hour advance notification requirements of the Pesticide Neighbor Notification Law must be followed - see Public Notification, Education, &amp; the Neighbor Notification Law below.</p>
<h4>PEST IDENTIFICATION</h4>
<p>Without going into great detail, it helps if you can identify the pest you are dealing with prior to taking action.  This is especially true when dealing with bed bugs.  If you are not certain, you can contact your pest management company, or your BOCES Health and Safety Officer. </p>


<h4>PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS</h4>
<h5>Here are some simple recommendations to help manage pest control</h5>
<ul>
<li>Keep doors shut properly when not in use.</li>
<li>Place weather stripping/door-sweeps on doors.</li>
<li>Caulk and seal openings in walls, around pipes, cracks, and crevices.</li>
<li>Install or repair screens on windows, vents, floor drains, and louvers.</li>
<li>Routinely clean floor drains and grates.</li>
<li>Fix dripping faucets.</li>
<li>Sweep and mop floors daily.</li>
<li>Empty trash baskets daily and wash them when necessary.</li>
<li>Vacuum carpeted areas daily using a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) vacuum system.</li>
<li>Keep vegetation, shrubs, and wood mulch at least one foot from structures.</li>
<li>Remove tree stumps and wood debris.</li>
<li>Power-wash areas with accumulated debris, such as floor drains, loading docks, dumpsters, and food carts.</li>
<li>Regularly clean grease from ovens, exhaust vents, and grease traps.</li>
<li>Ensure that dumpster, recycling, and trash compactor bins close securely and dumpsters are kept away from the buildings.</li>
<li>Repair cracks and leaks in damaged floors, walls, and roofs.</li>
<li>Replace moldy ceiling tiles, carpet, and other damaged items.</li>
</ul>
						
<h5>The following are some suggested steps in implementing this program. Students and staff should be educated to do the following in classrooms, faculty rooms, offices, and lockers:</h5>
						<ul>
<li>Consume food only in designated areas.</li>
<li>Clean up and properly dispose of leftover food.</li>
<li>Do not leave food in lockers or desks.</li>
<li>Store food and beverages only in designated areas and in tightly sealed containers.</li>
<li>Promptly dispose of any trash that contains food.</li>
<li>Keep instructional food items (items used in home &amp; career class) in tightly sealed containers.</li>
<li>Keep areas in and near refrigerators, vending machines, and microwaves clean and free of spills.</li>
	</ul>
	
<h4>RECORD KEEPING</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>According to the EPA, "accurate records of inspecting, identifying, and monitoring activities show changes in the site environment (reduced availability of food, water, or shelter), physical changes (exclusion and repairs), pest population changes (increased or reduced numbers, older or younger pests), or changes in the amount of damage or loss."</li>
					<li>Copies of pesticide labels, MSDS, as well as the date, time, and pest-specific pesticide application locations must also be recorded. Finally, the name of the applicator and a photocopy of their DEC certification should also be retained. Information on pesticide products must also be recorded pursuant to Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) regulations. All IPM and pesticide application records should be made available for inspection to anyone who wants to review such materials.</li>
					<li>The State Pesticide Reporting Law (PRL) (Chapter 279 of the Laws of 1996) mandates pesticide applicators and technicians, including school districts who employ certified applicators, to record and report, at least annually, all pesticide applications to DEC. This reporting requirement includes pesticide applications that have been performed by DEC certified school personnel. The annual report must be sent to DEC no later than February 1 of the year following the calendar year for which the report is submitted. The information and records maintained for each pesticide application must be retained for at least three years. The information which must be maintained includes: the EPA registration number of the pesticide which was applied; the product name; the quantity of each pesticide used; the date on which the pesticide was applied; and the location of the pesticide application by address (including the five-digit zip code). The pesticide dosage rate, the method of application, the target organism, as well as the place of application must also be recorded. Questions pertaining to this law should be directed to the: DEC Bureau of Pesticides Management, Pesticides Reporting Section at 1-888-457-0110 (toll-free from within New York State).</li>

						</ul>					
					
<h4>ESTABLISHMENT OF TOLERANCE AND RESPONSE ACTIONS</h4>
<p>A tolerance and action threshold defines the point at which specific pests can no longer be tolerated, thus initiating a pest-specific treatment action. For example, the presence of rodents inside a school building poses a potential health threat that must be addressed as soon as possible.  One fly in a classroom should elicit a very different response than the sighting of a bee's nest on a playground.  Remember, eliminating the source of food will help prevent pest issues.  When you see a problem, note it and keep an eye on the issue.  Take action as needed.</p> 
<p>IPM response actions include the use of mechanical, biological, and physical treatments and, as a last resort, least toxic pest specific pesticides. Traps should never be placed in areas readily accessible to students where they may be disturbed, moved, or tampered with.  The use of vacuums, screens, caulk, and traps are examples of mechanical and physical controls for managing pests such as flies, ants, and termites. For example, a strong vacuum, including a crevice attachment, can suck cockroaches, their droppings, and their eggs from cracks. A tablespoon of cornstarch in the vacuum bag will ensure the pest's death.</p>
<p>Information on biopesticides may be found at www.epa.gov/pesticides/biopesticides/ . Unfortunately, biopesticides are not yet available for all pests. In the absence of such products, it is important that schools be very careful not to use any products which are known, probable, or possible carcinogens, neurotoxic organophosphates, or pesticides classified by the EPA as having high acute toxicity.</p>
<p>The State Education Department strongly recommends that schools only employ mature individuals who are at least twenty-one years old to apply pesticide products in schools and on school grounds, who are also certified by the DEC as a pesticide applicator. DEC law requires that the applicator must provide a copy of the pesticide label to the building owner prior to the actual application.</p>
<p>DEC further requires the person applying a pesticide to possess a copy of the label for the product, which is being applied at the time of the application, as well as their current DEC applicator certification card. It is illegal for any individual other than those noted above to apply any pesticide products in a school building or on school grounds. Specific questions relating to the DEC pesticide regulation may be directed to DEC regional offices throughout the state.</p>
<h4>Public Notification, Education, &amp; the Neighbor Notification Law</h4>
<p>If you are going to apply a pesticide, you need to know and follow these notification requirements.  The Pesticide Neighbor Notification Law, Section 409-h of the Education Law applies to all public and nonpublic elementary and secondary schools and details specific parties who must be notified, as well as the times and circumstances related to such notification.</p>
<p>This requirement states that schools provide a written notice to all parents, guardians, and staff at the beginning of each school year that includes the following points:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>a statement that pesticide products may be used periodically throughout the school year.</li>
							<li>a statement that schools are required to maintain a list of parents, guardians, and staff who wish to receive 48 hour written advanced notice from the school of an actual pesticide application.</li>
							<li>the name of the school representative to contact for further information.</li>
						</ul>
<p>At least 48 hours prior to an actual application, an additional written notice must be disseminated to all parents, guardians, and staff that have registered to receive the advanced application notification. This notification must explain the following:</p>
	<ul>			
<li>the specific date and location of the upcoming pesticide application;</li>
<li>the pesticide product name and EPA product registration number;</li>
<li>the name of the school representative to contact for further information.</li>
		</ul>
<p>The 48-hour notice must also include the following statement:</p>
<p>This notice is to inform you of a pending pesticide application to a school facility. You may wish to discuss with the designated school representative what precautions are being taken to protect your child from exposure to these pesticides. Further information about the product(s) being applied, including any warnings that appear on the label of the pesticide(s) that are pertinent to the protection of humans, animals, or the environment, can be obtained by calling the National Pesticide Telecommunications Network Information phone number 1-800-858-7378 or the New York State Department of Health Center for Environmental Health info line at 1-800-458-1158.</p>
						
<p>If a public health emergency exists which does not allow for the full 48 hour prior notification, the school must still make a good faith effort to notify those on the 48 hour list prior to the application.</p>
<p>The 48 hour notification registry and written notification provides parents and staff an opportunity to receive an accurate and timely accounting of what pesticide products have been and will be used in school buildings and on school grounds.</p>

<p>The following applications are not subject to prior notification requirements:</p>
						<ul>
						
							<li>a school remains unoccupied for a continuous 72 hours following an application;</li>
							<li>anti-microbial products;</li>
							<li>nonvolatile rodenticides in tamper resistant bait stations in areas inaccessible to children;</li>
							<li>nonvolatile insecticidal baits in tamper resistant bait stations in areas inaccessible to children;							</li>
							<li>silica gels and other nonvolatile ready-to-use pastes, foams, or gels in areas inaccessible to children;</li>
							<li>boric acid and disodium octaborate tetrahydrate;</li>
							<li>the application of EPA designated biopesticides;</li>
							<li>the application of EPA designated exempt materials under 40CFR152.25;</li>
							<li>the use of aerosol products with a directed spray in containers of 18 fluid ounces or less when used to protect individuals from an imminent threat from stinging and biting insects including venomous spiders, bees, wasps, and hornets;</li>
							
							</ul>
<p>In general, a school district can avoid the 48-hour notification process by designing an IPM program that is restricted to the above noted items.</p>
						
<p>Finally, all schools must also provide additional written notification to all parents, guardians, and staff three times each year to inform them of any pesticide applications that have occurred. Notification must occur at the following intervals:</p>
						
<li>within ten days of the end of the school year;</li>
<li>within two school days of the end of winter recess;</li>
<li>within two school days of the end of spring recess.</li>
						
Notifications must include the following information for the period since the previous notice:
						
the dates and locations of pesticide applications;
the products used for each application which required prior notification;
information on emergency applications;
a reminder that persons may add their names to the 48-hour notification registry.
						
<p>In addition to the requirements specified in the Pesticide Neighbor Notification Law, it also recommended that schools post a notice concerning any actual pesticide applications at the entrance of the building. A posted notice will serve to inform individuals not on the 48-hour registry and visitors to the building of the applications.</p>

<!--******************OUTDOOR PEST APPLICTION SECTION*************** -->

<h3>OUTDOOR PESTICIDE APPLICATION</h3>
						
<p>This section refers to what you spray outside your buildings and is still considered pest management.  Environmental Conservation Law (ECL) 33‐0101.35 “Pesticide” means:</p>
	
a. Any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest; and 
b. Any substance or mixture of substances intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant or desiccant.

GUIDANCE ON CHAPTER 85, LAWS OF 2010
SUMMARY OF PESTICIDE PROHIBITION REQUIREMENTS AND PESTICIDE ALTERNATIVES REGARDING SCHOOLS AND DAY CARE CENTERS IN NEW YORK STATE
DECEMBER 22, 2010

<p>In May 2010, New York State enacted Chapter 85 of the Laws of 2010 (Chapter 85), a new law containing limitations regarding pesticide use on playing fields and playgrounds at schools and day care centers. This guidance is intended to help schools and day care centers comply with the new law, by providing information on its requirements and on allowable alternatives to pesticides for grounds maintenance.

WHAT THE NEW LAW REQUIRES
	
Amendments to Existing Laws and Identification of Involved New York State Agencies: 
	
	<p>Under Chapter 85, new requirements were added to the State Education Law (SEL) and the Social Services Law (SSL). The State Education Department (SED) is responsible for administering the sections of the SEL added by Chapter 85, and the State Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) is responsible for administering the new sections of the SSL. Also, a requirement was added to the Environmental Conservation Law (ECL) for the State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) to develop this guidance. Chapter 85 is summarized in the remainder of this Section of the guidance. See Section E (Where to Read the Law and Ask Questions) for information on where to read the new requirements and which agency to contact with questions. DEC’s role in the implementation of the new requirements is limited to issuing this guidance and to being one of the entities authorized to make determinations regarding emergency pesticide applications. (See Section D Emergency Determinations.)

Guidance: As required under Chapter 85, DEC developed this guidance in consultation with the State Department of Health (State DOH) and the SED. DEC also consulted OCFS.

Pesticide Prohibition and Exceptions: Schools and day care centers are prohibited from using pesticides on playgrounds (includes playground equipment), turf, and athletic or playing fields. The prohibition does not apply to indoor use of pesticides or pesticide applications to buildings or structures (e.g. school buildings, garages). If you have questions about whether a portion of grounds are subject to the law, contact SED or OCFS (see Section E for contact information). In general, “pesticide” covers a broad range of products: insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, rodenticides, and others. The new law specifies that “pesticide” has the same meaning as under Section 33‐0101.35 of the ECL1. However, under the new law, “pesticide” does not include six types of pesticide products, which can be applied on playgrounds, turf, and athletic or playing fields at schools and day care centers. For details about these exceptions, see Section C (Which Pesticides Are Allowed). NOTE: Under a separate new law, (Chapter 205 of the Laws of 2010), fertilizer use restrictions become effective January 1, 2012. Please see “Attention” section at the end of this guidance.

Emergency Pesticide Applications: An exception from the pesticide prohibition is provided for emergency applications, which may be made only as determined by entities specified in the new law (e.g. schools boards and certain State agencies). For further information, see Section D (Emergency Determinations).

Who Must Comply: The new requirements apply to schools and day care centers, as defined in the SEL and SSL. These encompass public school districts (including the New York City (NYC) Department of Education), non‐public schools, boards of cooperative education (BOCES), and child and Head Start day care centers. The law also applies to a school or day care center located at a college or university. The law does not apply to family day care centers, group family day care centers, school‐age child care programs, day care centers in the five boroughs of NYC. To find out if this new law applies to a specific school or day care center, contact SED or OCFS, as applicable (see Section E Where to Read the Law and Ask Questions).

When to Comply: The prohibition, exceptions, emergency allowance and other provisions go into effect on November 14, 2010 for day care centers and May 18, 2011 for schools.

<p>Pesticide Application Requirements: Schools and day care centers must continue to comply with previously existing requirements when applying pesticides, including when applying those pesticides excepted from the prohibition in Chapter 85. Section C (Which Pesticides Are Allowed) and the “Attention” at the end of this guidance provide a summary of existing State requirements regarding pesticide use and pesticide application notification.

HOW TO MAINTAIN CHILD‐SAFE PLAYING FIELDS AND TURF WITHOUT PESTICIDES

Managing Grounds with Alternatives to Pesticides:  Many schools and day care centers already care for their grounds without the use of conventional pesticides. Others, however, may be making the shift away from pesticides for the first time. Depending on their current practices, schools and day care centers may only need to fine tune their methods, or they may need to learn a new, systematic approach to sustainable grounds maintenance through alternatives to pesticides. Training in alternative methods of grounds management could help those with less experience successfully make the transition. Check the on‐line resources in this section for links to training programs.

General Guidance on Pesticide Alternatives and Additional resources:  There are a number of
things to consider when managing grounds without pesticides, ranging from familiarity


with the grounds and potential trouble spots to soil and plant health. Because the steps taken for grounds management are specific to each school or day care center, this guidance is necessarily intended as a starting point, rather than a handbook to address every situation at schools and day care centers.

Broad Tips and Concepts: The table on the next two pages outlines overall concepts for use in complying with the new pesticide prohibition. Information on the table serves as an introduction to alternative approaches to grounds maintenance and pest management as well as bottom line rules about soil and plant health. The “right” combination of alternatives to pesticides to prevent and manage pest infestations and for maintaining healthy, resilient grounds is specific to each school and day care center.

References to Resources for Further Information on grounds management without pesticides are provided in the table and following it.

<h3>GENERAL GUIDANCE ON PESTICIDE ALTERNATIVES PROPER GROUNDS MANAGEMENT – BASELINE CONCEPTS</h3><br>
	<h4>Look at the Big Picture</h4>
		<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Examine the whole outdoor system. Walk around the site and get an overall understanding of the maintenance needs and where steps should be taken to ensure that it is healthy – able to withstand pests and environmental stresses. Be aware of all possible sources of pest infestations, including dumpsters and recycling containers, and ensure that they are clean and well‐maintained.</p>
	<h4>Check for these Conditions</h4>
		<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Take note of areas and site characteristics that already have, or are prone to, pest or disease problems for plants, turf and soil. The following are examples of important conditions to check for:</p>
						<ul style="margin-left: 60px;">
							<li>overall health of turf or plants,</li> 
							<li>existing pest (insects, weeds, etc.) and disease infestations or areas that appear to have pest‐or disease‐prone conditions. Identify any existing pest/disease to choose proper management method (see Cooperative Extension link below),</li>
							<li>poorly drained soil (i.e. pools of water or mud present), or soil that is hard and compacted,</li>
							<li>shady or sunny areas,</li>
							<li>storm or seasonal damage,</li>
							<li>heavy foot traffic areas.</li>
						</ul>
	<h4>Make a Response Plan</h4>
		<ul style="margin-left: 60px;">
			<li>Consider whether a certain level of weeds and pests can be acceptable and tolerated at the school or day care centers.</li>
			<li>Decide which areas of the grounds need special attention.</li>
		</ul>


	<h4>Maintain Soil Health</h4>
		<ul style="margin-left: 15px;">
			<li>Soil Conditions: Keep soils well‐drained, properly watered, aerated, and high in organic matter. A variety of soil aeration tools can be found in garden catalogs and supply stores. Organic matter can be enhanced by adding compost, or leaving grass clippings on the lawn after cutting. Adding organic matter will help with drainage as well as soil fertility. Better drainage in heavy clay soils can also be achieved by adding sand or lighter, loamy soil. Ask at a garden supply store for these materials.</li>
	
			<li>pH: Check for a healthy pH (pH should be close to 7, which is neutral). Soil testing will help determine pH and if nutrient deficiencies exist. A link to Cornell Cooperative Extension’s soil testing service is provided below.</li>
	
			<li>Soil Amendments: Consider whether soil amendments, such as compost or fertilizer, are needed and which are appropriate for site conditions. PH and other soil conditions can be adjusted by adding the appropriate compost, fertilizer, or lime, available from gardening catalogs and supply stores.</li>
		</ul>
<p>Web resource for soil testing: http://cnal.cals.cornell.edu/</p>
	
<h4>Select the Right Turf and Plants</h4>
<ul style="margin-left: 15px;">
	<li>Select turf and plant varieties and/or mixes that are well‐adapted to the site (such as soil type, and sun/shade characteristics) and climate. To the extent possible, select disease‐ and insect‐resistant varieties.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Maintain Healthy Turf and Plants</h4>
	<p style="margin-left: 15px;">Manage turf and plants to create healthy conditions that prevent pests and plant diseases. Examples of cultural management practices include:</p>
	
	<ul style="margin-left: 60px;">
		<li>Remove diseased plants and debris from the grounds.</li>
		<li>Keep grass longer (at least 3 inches) to promote a healthy root structure that can out‐compete weeds. Keep mower blades sharp to avoid damaging grass. Damage increases its vulnerability to diseases, insects, and weeds.</li>
		<li>Spread new grass seed each year, to cover bare patches and to crowd out weeds in established areas.</li>
		<li>Revisit the grounds frequently to check that the methods used are improving areas of concern and adjust management techniques accordingly.</li>

<p>NOTE: Prohibited pesticides could be referenced on internet sites or in resources consulted by schools, day care centers and others. Prohibited pesticides cannot be used at schools and day care centers in New York State, even if referenced in resources, including those listed above.
Therefore, when consulting these or any other resources about grounds maintenance options,schools and day care centers should focus on information about pesticide alternatives and soil, plant, and turf care.</p>

<h4>WHICH PESTICIDES ARE ALLOWED</h4>

<p>Establishing healthy grounds is the best way to prevent pest problems. Should the need for pesticides arise, however, the following is a list of types of pesticide products allowed under the new law and information about how to identify them.</p>

<li>Antimicrobial products are available in several forms, such as sprays, liquids, and concentrated powders, and contain active ingredients such as bleach. There are only a few antimicrobial products registered for use on artificial turf. Also, although fungi are microbes, this excepted category for antimicrobials does not include fungicides used on turf and plants for the purpose of controlling plant diseases. Use Examples: Antimicrobials are designed to destroy or suppress the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria or viruses, often on inanimate objects and surfaces.</li>

<li>Aerosol sprays in 18 ounce cans (or smaller) can be readily identified by their packaging. As specified in the law, these are only to be used to protect individuals from imminent threat from a stinging or biting insect (venomous spiders, bees, wasps and hornets). These sprays are not meant for long‐term pest management. Consult the internet resources under Section B (B. How To Maintain Child‐Safe Playing Fields and Turf Without Pesticides) for ways to remove the sources of the hazards posed by stinging insects, such as covering garbage cans and removing yard waste which may attract and harbor such pests. Use Examples: These aerosols are used to control bees and wasps.</li>

<li>Non‐volatile insect and rodent baits in tamper resistant containers are, in general, self‐
containerized childproof packages or “stations” containing pesticidal bait. Depending upon the product, the container can be purchased with the bait in it or the container can be empty and a certified applicator can fill it with the bait and secure it prior to use (For additional information on EPA's criteria for tamper‐resistant bait stations see: http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/PR_Notices/pr94‐7.html
). Not allowed under this exception are baits packaged as pellets, granules, treated grain, or any other loose form that can lead to potential exposure to children, non‐target organisms and the environment or gel baits in syringes that are applied when squeezed. Use Examples: Bait stations are usually used for rodent, roach, and ant control.</li>

<li>Products containing boric acid or disodium octaborate tetrahydrate will have those
ingredients listed on the label. They are, in general, insecticide products containing these chemicals in powder form. Use Examples: Products with these ingredients are used to help control wood‐boring insects, ants and silverfish.</li>




<p>Horticultural oils and soaps that do not contain synthetic pesticides or synergists are
generally identifiable by reading the label. Make sure the active ingredients listed are limited to paraffinic oil, mineral oil, petroleum oil, citrus oil, or combinations of salts of fatty acids. Most products labeled as horticultural oil, summer oil, dormant oil, or insecticidal soap will not contain synthetic pesticides or synergists, and will therefore be allowed. If you are unsure, look for the acronym “OMRI” on the label. OMRI stands for the Organic Materials Review Institute and horticultural oils and soaps with that label will meet the law’s criteria. Use Examples: Such oils and soaps are used, among other purposes, to manage some plant pests, such as aphids, spider mites and leaf hoppers.</p>

<p>Pesticides classified as exempt by U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are not
registered by EPA, because they contain ingredients EPA considers to pose little or no risk. (These products are also known as Minimum Risk Pesticides or 25(b) exempt pesticides.) A list of those ingredients is on the next page. Schools and day care centers considering use of the EPA‐exempt products should investigate the potential uses, as there is more information than is feasible to include in this guidance (EPA resource listed below). Use Examples: Corn gluten meal may be used for managing pre‐emergent weeds (e.g. crabgrass and dandelions); soybean oil may be used on scales, mites, aphids and other insects; and dried blood is sometimes used as a repellent for deer or rabbits.</p>

<p>There is no comprehensive list of EPA Minimum Risk Pesticides, but there are ways to identify them:</p>

<li>It may be noted on the label that the product is an EPA Minimum Risk Pesticide, but such an indication is not required.</li>

<li>All ingredients in an EPA Minimum Risk Pesticide must be listed on the label by name and the pesticide can only contain inert ingredients that are minimal risk. An EPA Minimum Risk Pesticide can ONLY contain one or more of the active ingredients listed on the next page.</li>

<p>Information on EPA‐exempt pesticides can be found at: http://www.epa.gov/oppbppd1/biopesticides/regtools/25b_list.htm<br><br>

EMERGENCY DETERMINATIONS














The purpose of the new law is to minimize the harmful effects of pesticides on children by limiting the use of aesthetic pesticides in sensitive areas such as schools and day care centers and develop pesticide alternatives. An exception to the pesticide prohibition is provided in the State Education Law (SEL) and Social Services Law (SSL). Use of a prohibited pesticide is allowed, when a determination is made that an emergency application is needed.
Schools and day care centers subject to the law must seek an emergency determination from the appropriate entity. The entities which may make such determinations are identified in the SED and SSL.3 The primary entities are county health departments, State DOH, DEC, and, in the case of public schools’ requests for determinations, school boards.
The DEC, State DOH, SED and OCFS together, based on their interpretation of Chapter 85, have identified a working framework for emergency determinations, so that schools and day care centers know which entity to contact when seeking an emergency determination to apply a

3 Provisions regarding emergency pesticide applications are included in section 409‐k.2 of the State Education Law and section 390‐g.2 of the Social Services Law, both of which read as follows: “No school [or day care] shall apply pesticide to any playgrounds, turf, athletic or playing fields, except that an emergency application of a pesticide may be made as determined by the county health department or for a county not having a health department such authority as the county legislature shall designate, the commissioner of health or his or her designee, the commissioner of environmental conservation or his or her designee, or, in the case of a public school, the school board.”


prohibited pesticide. Also included in the framework are the types of emergencies DEC, State DOH and county health departments will consider. (State DOH oversees most county health departments.)
FRAMEWORK FOR IDENTIFYING THE ENTITY A SCHOOL OR DAY CARE CENTER WOULD CONTACT to seek an
emergency determination to apply a prohibited pesticide is outlined below, based on whether a public school, non‐public school, or day care center is seeking the determination:
Public Schools:  Each public school must contact its school board to seek an emergency pesticide application determination for any type of situation that may warrant an emergency. The SED has interpreted the SEL to require that the local school boards make all emergency determinations for public schools. Public schools should not contact the State DOH, county health departments or DEC to seek an emergency pesticide application determination. A school board, as it deliberates, may consult those agencies with relevant questions (as well as the in‐house expertise of its grounds managers). Specifically, school boards may contact the county health department or the State DOH to consult on public health‐related emergency situations and they may contact the DEC with questions about environmentally‐related emergency situations.
Non‐Public Schools and Day Care Centers: These entities should contact either the DOH or the DEC, depending upon whether the emergency request relates to the need to apply a prohibited pesticide for a public health‐related matter or an environment‐related matter, as follows:
Public Health‐related Emergency Pesticide Application Determinations: Non‐public schools and daycare centers should contact the DOH (the county health department, State DOH district office in certain counties or the state DOH's Bureau of Toxic Substance Assessment), when a pest issue arises that may warrant an emergency application of a prohibited pesticide to protect public health (e.g. residual larvicide treatments on grounds to control mosquitoes that carry Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus). The DOH will make determinations for emergency pesticide applications only when a pest poses a significant threat to public health.
To Contact the DOH about Public Health‐related Emergency Determinations: Contact the county health department or applicable district office (telephone number for each county on attached list) or the State DOH, Bureau of Toxic Substance Assessment at 518‐402‐7820.
Environment‐related Emergency Pesticide Application Determinations: Non‐ public schools and day care centers should contact the DEC in writing to seek an emergency determination, when an emergency arises which would significantly affect the environment (e.g. invasive species management). For


the form on which requests are to be made to DEC, see the Department website http://www.dec.ny.gov.
To Contact DEC about Environment‐related Emergency Determinations for Non‐public Schools and Day Care Centers: Contact the DEC Bureau of Pest Management at: 518‐402‐8788. Use the form at the above link to submit requests to DEC for emergency determinations.

<h4>Guidance for determining when a Situation is an Emergency</h4>
	
<p>The intent of the new law is to require schools and day care centers to manage grounds and pests without pesticides. Emergency determinations should only be sought or granted for a one‐time pesticide application for a specific situation, which presents a true emergency. To provide guidance on deciding when a situation is not an emergency, the DEC, State DOH and SED, in consultation with OCFS, identified the following situations that these state agencies generally would not consider to warrant an emergency pesticide application determination:</p>
	<ul>
	
<li>when the problem can be managed with the allowed products and/or alternative pest management methods (even when it takes time to learn and fully practice pesticide alternatives).</li>

	<li>for routine or repetitive pest problems. Pest problems can occur on a regular or seasonal basis, but they do not usually rise to the level of a public health or environmental threat that constitutes an emergency.</li>
<li>when the pesticide application would be for purely aesthetic (non‐emergency) reasons.</li>

</ul>

<h4>ATTENTION SCHOOLS AND DAY CARE CENTERS: OTHER REQUIREMENTS</h4>

<p>Separate from the requirements in Chapter 85, Laws of 2010, there are other new and existing requirements, which schools and day cares must be aware of and comply with, in regard to grounds maintenance and pest management. A summary of them is included below:</p>

<h4>New Fertilizer Use Restrictions</h4>
<p>Under a separate new law, Chapter 205 of the Laws of 2010, starting January 1, 2012, new restrictions go into effect regarding the use of phosphorus fertilizers and fertilizers on lawns and non‐agricultural turf. As of that date, the following are prohibited on lawns or non‐agricultural turf:</p>
	<ul>
<li>The use of phosphorus fertilizers, unless establishing a new lawn or a soil test shows phosphorus is needed for growth, and

<li>The use of fertilizers between December 1 and April 1 annually.</li>

<li>The use of fertilizers is prohibited within 20 feet of any surface water except:</li>
		<ul>
<li>Where a continuous natural vegetation buffer, at least 10 feet wide, separates lawn and water.</li>

<li>Where a spreader guard, deflector shield or drop spreader is used, then the application may not occur within three 3 feet of any surface water.</li>
		</ul></ul>

<p>Additionally, fertilizer cannot be used on any impervious surfaces, and, if such an application occurs, it must be cleaned immediately and legally applied or placed in an appropriate container. Details can be found at  www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/67239.html  on the DEC website.</p>








<h4>Pesticide Certification, Notification, and Reporting Requirements</h4>

<p>Anyone who applies pesticides to buildings or grounds at schools or day care centers, including pesticides allowed under the new law, must meet existing pesticide requirements.4 The following is a summary of these requirements:</p>
	<ul>

<li>The definition of a pesticide is contained in Section 33‐0101.35 of the ECL. Under that definition, all of the exceptions to the ban listed in Section C (Which Pesticides are Allowed) above are classified by DEC as pesticides and are subject to applicable regulations that relate to pesticide use. See http://www.dec.ny.gov/regulations/8527.html for information on DEC pesticide requirements in law and regulation.</li>

<li>Sections 33‐0905 and 33‐0907 of the ECL and related regulatory requirements in 6 NYCRR Part 325 contain pesticide applicator certification and business or agency registration requirements.4 (Under the regulation, certification is not required when using antimicrobials, except where used in cooling towers (exist at some schools) or other processes not present at schools.)</li>

<li>Pesticide reporting requirements under Section 33‐1205 of the ECL apply to all pesticides used, except antimicrobials and EPA‐exempt pesticides (also referred to as EPA Minimum Risk Pesticides or 25(b) pesticides).</li>

<li>Pesticide application notification requirements must be met when using pesticides on structures or grounds, under Section 409‐h of the SEL and Section 390‐c of the SSL.</li>

					<div class="text-content">
						
						<p style="margin-left: 20px;">The inspection of Rolling Fire Doors is an annual requirement, and these inspections are typically performed by a door company.  There are 2 types of rolling doors with one being tied to your fire alarm system and other is not.  Inspections for those tied to your fire alarm system are required to be performed each year.  The doors are tested to verify they work in a smooth manner and do not bind when raised or lowered.  This is important as these doors will need to drop in the event of a fire.  The doors will drop with either the failure of a fusible link or from a signal from the fire alarm system, or both. During a fire door drop test, the technician is required to test by all means of activation. This means if the door can be activated thermally (by fusible links that melt when they reach a certain temperature) or electrically (by a fire door system connected to a smoke or fire alarm), it must be drop tested using all means of activation.  It is imperative to keep areas below the doors clear so they can drop and seal.  These doors are traditionally found in kitchen areas around service areas.  Rollup doors in Technology/Shop are also common.  Like all inspections performed by outside contractors, you must file the inspection reports.  These reports should be kept on file for at least 3 years per NFPA 80 Standards.</p>
    					<font color="red"><strong>Section 5.2.5 of NFPA 80-2010</strong></font> states, “horizontal sliding, vertical sliding or overhead rolling fire doors, the following must be verified”:

				<h3>Stage Rigging</h3>
        		<h5>By Dana W. Taylor of NFHS.org</h5>
    
    				<p style="margin-left: 20px;" class="doctext">Stage rigging (counterweight rigging) describes the mechanisms used to lower and raise the pipes over the stage. These pipes (battens) carry stage lights, curtains, acoustical shells and sometimes scenery. Rigging maintenance begins with an inspection by a qualified inspector.</p>
    
    				<p>According to the American National Standards Institute’s document ANSI E1.47: Recommended Guidelines for Entertainment Rigging Inspections (2017), “The inspector should have a minimum of five years or 10,000 hours of experience including a combination of entertainment rigging systems design, engineering, inspection, installation, maintenance, service, repair, modification and functional testing. Typically, experience only in system operation will not provide suitable experience to inspect entertainment rigging systems.” (ANSI E1.47 is currently under public review in an effort to provide greater clarity; however, recommendations as a whole have not changed.)</p>
    
    				<p>The ANSI recommendation is that all rigging systems should be inspected annually, a Level 1 inspection that focuses on those system elements that are easily accessed by an inspector. In addition to checking all components of the system, the inspector will look for appropriate signage regarding system-weight capacities and safety/warning signage. The inspector will also ask for the facility logbook (written record of rigging issues, inspections, repairs), crew training documentation and documents pertaining to flame retardancy of all stage curtains.</p>
    
    				<p>Following the inspection, the user will receive a written inspection report on the condition of the system, notification of issues and recommended remedies. The inspector will not do any repairs. For motorized rigging, a Level 2 inspection is recommended each year.</p>
    
    				<p>Level 2 inspections are more thorough and are recommended every five years, unless the date of the last inspection cannot be determined or equipment has been newly installed, altered or repaired. In those instances, the first inspection will be a Level 2. The Level 2 inspection will likely necessitate the availability of a man lift and will include all elements of a Level 1 inspection, plus a thorough look at those less readily accessible elements of your system.</p>
    
    				<h4>Cost</h4>

    				<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Inspection costs vary based on the type and complexity of your system and your proximity to a qualified inspector. You should expect to pay for the inspection and travel costs (transportation, hotel and per diem) for the inspector. The author’s latest Level 1 inspection (Spring 2018) was $2,300 and included two hotel nights, airfare and a one-day inspection of his 17-line set manual counterweight system.</p>
    
    				<p>Assistance with the expense of rigging inspections is available from the United States Institute for Theatre Technology’s (USITT) Rigging Safety Initiative. Secondary schools may apply twice each year for a grant covering the cost of the inspection. In some instances, where a recognized inspector is nearby, the grant may cover the entire cost of the inspection. For more information, visit www.usitt.org. The grant also covers four hours of training for up to eight staff members and students.  Here is the link to the application  https://www.usitt.org/rsi</p>
    
    				<h4>Risk Management, Liability and Protecting Your Investment</h4>
    
    				<p>Although many rigging accidents can be attributed to user error, rigging inspections should be added to your school risk management and accident prevention programs. With regard to liability, ignorance is not a legally defensible position. Annual inspections, and acting on the inspector’s recommendations may mitigate potential liability should there be an accident. Likewise, ongoing training for school staff and students further shows the school’s desire to protect users and audiences.</p>
    
    				<p>Rigging is an expensive part of your school’s auditorium. Consequently, inspections, maintenance and training not only protect your students, staff and audiences but your investment as well.</p>

    				<p>ANSI E1.4-2014 section 5.2.2.1 Installed systems shall be inspected annually or more frequently, as determined by a qualified person, per the manufacturer’s recommendations and local code requirements.</p>
    
    				<p>OSHA 1926.1501(a)(6) A thorough, annual inspection of the hoisting machinery shall be made by a competent person, or by a government or private agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor. The employer shall maintain a record of the dates and results of inspections for each hoisting machine and piece of equipment.</p>

		<div class="topic-header">ELEVATORS</div>
			<div class="text-content"><p>Below are the details with respect to elevator inspections which are from the NYSED Facilities Planning Manual.  If your district has an elevator in one of your buildings, you are required to have a valid inspection certificate for that elevator.  You will work with two companies for the elevator inspection and that is the company who does your service and preventative maintenance work, and a company who is the “Witness Company” for the annual inspection.  The Witness Company is there to observe the elevator inspection and they are the ones who will issue the Elevator Inspection Certificate.  The Witness Company must be independent from your elevator service company.</p><br>
				
			<p>Elevator inspections are typically performed every 6 months with a Certification Inspection done by the Witness Company annually.  These inspections can be performed at any time during the year, but you should try to schedule these inspections to allow for the inconvenience of taking the elevator out of service during your PM or inspection procedure.</p><br>
				
<p>The time intervals for inspections and testing of elevators, as determined by the NYS Department of State (Table N1, Appendix N of ASME A17.1, 2000 edition) will apply to all elevators.  In general, elevators must be inspected every six months.  Various elevator devices must be tested every one, three or five years, depending upon the device being tested. </p><br>
				
<p>Persons performing elevator inspections must be certified by an organization in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Standard for the Qualification of Elevator Inspectors (ASME QEI-1).  The tests must be witnessed by persons holding the same qualifications as inspectors.</p><br>
				
<p>Maintenance, repair, and replacement activities performed on elevators must be performed by elevator personnel.  Elevator personnel are persons who have been trained in the construction, maintenance, repair, inspection or testing of equipment.  Although they may have the certification that they meet ASME QEI-1, it is not a requirement to hold this certification for maintenance, repair, and replacement activities.
Building owners should determine which edition their elevator installation was provided under, and research the specific requirements for their elevators.  Each installation should have a code data plate located on the equipment, indicating the edition of the standard at the time of installation, the edition of the standard at the time of alteration, and the items altered.  The following documents and/or document sections may help in determining specific elevator requirements:</p><br>
				<ul>
				
<li>ASME A17.1-2000, “Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators</li>
<li>Section 8.6, “Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement”</li>
<li>Section 8.11, “Periodic Inspections and Tests”</li>
<li>SME A17.2-2004, “Guide for Inspection of Elevators, Escalators, and Moving Walks”.  This document is helpful in that it calls out the different inspection and testing procedures for previous editions of ASME A17.1 back to the 1955 edition, and includes some requirements from editions of ASME A17.1 prior to 1955.  There are some earlier editions of this document that may be available, and would be acceptable to assist in determining inspection and testing procedures for installations prior to the date of issuance.  These are: ASME A17.2-2001, “Guide for Inspection of Elevators, Escalators, and Moving Walks”; ASME A17.2.1-1996, “Inspectors’ Manual for Electric Elevators”; ASME A17.2.2-1997, “Inspectors’ Manual for Hydraulic Elevators”.</li>
</ul><br>
<h5>Inspection Certificates:</h5>
<p>You will receive a document from your Witness Inspection Company that will state when the certification expires, note any violations, and will be specific to each elevator inspected.  Some companies will give you an elevator certificate that you can post in the elevator, and others will give you an inspection report that is meant to be filed in your office.  Your fire inspector will most likely ask to see copies of your elevator inspections, so these should be filed and readily available for those requesting to see a copy of this document.</p>
<h5>Repairs of Defects:</h5>
<p>All defects as found in such periodic inspection reports shall be corrected within 90 days after the date of test.  All corrections should be documented, and this document should be placed in the file with your inspection report.</p>

<div id="section-lifts" class="tab-content">
			
		<div class="topic-header">AERIAL LIFTS</div>
			<div class="text-content"><p>Manlifts are to be inspected annually, including scissor lifts, single manlifts, and bucket trucks.  Before using a manlift, the operator should follow the operator’s checklist to be sure the lift is safe for use.  A generic form is available for your use or reference.  Be sure you have the proper PPE for operating the manlift.  You should have all staff members who will use the manlift properly trained before allowing them access to the manlift.  Your BOCES Health and Safety Manager, or the company who performs your preventative maintenance on your lifts should be able to offer training for your staff.  Be sure to document who has been trained and only permit those trained to use the lifts.
				
				
</p><h5>Pre-Start Inspections</h5>
<p>Each day and each shift must begin with an electric scissor lift inspection and function test. This allows operators to find and fix problems prior to starting the job. Inspections can also catch problems that may go unnoticed before creating a hazard. Walkaround visual inspections should occur daily, at shift changes or any time a new operator takes over the machine. </p>
 

Daily electric scissor lift inspections typically include:
				<ul>
<li>Checking for visible leakages (oil or battery fluids) or foreign objects.</li>
<li>Looking for dents, weld or metal cracks or other visible damage.</li>
<li>Checking the machine decals and placards to be sure they are clean and legible.</li>
<li>Inspecting scissor arms and centering link, as well as the platform gate to ensure it closes properly.</li>
<li>Checking the hydraulic fluid levels and cleanliness.</li>
<li>Verifying all applicable manuals are located on the machine</li>
</ul>
<p>A function check must also be completed before each use in an area free of overhead and ground-level obstructions. Accessories and attachments should also be inspected.</p>

<h5>General Maintenance Checklist</h5>
<p>Below are OSHA’s (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) guidelines for scissor lift maintenance. Be sure to reference the machine’s factory-issued manuals to ensure complete compliance. </p>

<h5>Operational</h5>
<ul>
<li>Check all fluid levels including oil, fuel, coolant and hydraulics. Inspect the machine thoroughly for leaks.</li>
<li>Check the wheels and tires. Look for worn tire treads and cracks or bubbles in the sidewalls. Make sure tire pressure is at the correct PSI. Check wheels for any structural damage.</li>
<li>Test the steering and brakes to ensure they are fully operational.</li>
<li>Check the battery and charge level to ensure power isn’t lost on the job.</li>
<li>Test all emergency controls to make sure they are working. This includes horns, gauges, lights and backup alarms.</li>
<li>Make sure all personal protection devices are in place and working properly. These include safety harnesses, fall protection gear and more. </li>
	
	</ul>
<h5>Structural</h5>

Inspect these areas for signs of any problems:
<ul>
<li>Air, electric, pneumatic, and hydraulic systems</li>
<li>Insulating components</li>
<li>Written warnings, placards and instructions</li>
<li>Mechanical fasteners and locking pins</li>
<li>Cable and wiring</li>
<li>Outriggers and stabilizers</li>
<li>Guardrails</li>
<li>Loose or missing parts</li>
	</ul>
<p>If any scissor lift components are damaged, missing or not working correctly, do not use the lift until it has been fully repaired. Work zone hazards must be removed or enclosed by barriers to keep the lift at a safe distance.</p>

<h5>Battery Maintenance</h5>
<p>Batteries are among the most frequent and highest cost drivers for scissor lift owners. Batteries that are not properly maintained will degrade over time and require premature replacement. Therefore, inspecting and maintaining batteries is critical to ensure they are adequately charged and water levels are sufficient. </p>

<div id="section-partitions" class="tab-content">
			
		<div class="topic-header">POWERED PARTITIONS</div>
			<div class="text-content"><p>Powered partitions are popular in school gymnasiums, large group instructional rooms, cafeterias, and other large spaces.  You are required to test the operation of the door’s safety system each year.  You are also required to train anyone who will be operating these doors (operators cannot by a student).  Your staff can perform the safety tests and if your staff does perform this test, you must have a written procedure for the test.  Typically the maintenance of these partition doors is daunting task and it is usually performed by a contractor.  If you have your partition doors on a preventative maintenance schedule with a contractor, you can also ask them to perform the safety test.</p>
				
				<p>Current through 2023 NY Law Chapter 276</p>
				<p>Section 409-F - Electrically operated partition and door safety</p><br>

<p>The board of education, trustees, principal or other person in charge of every public or private school or educational institution within the state, wherein classrooms or other facilities used by students are found to have electrically operated partitions, doors or room dividers, shall arrange for, and require, that:</p>
				<ol>
<li>Appropriate and conspicuous notice regarding the safe and proper operation and supervision of the electrical device operating such partition, door or room divider is posted in the immediate vicinity of the operating mechanism;</li>

<li>There is established a procedure for the notification of all school employees and all other persons who regularly make use of the area where such device is located of the safe and proper procedure for the operation of the mechanism and of the applicable penalties for disabling safety equipment required pursuant to this section; and</li>

<li>Every electrically operated partition or room divider shall be equipped with safety devices which, subject to standards established in rules and regulations promulgated by the commissioner, stop the forward motion of the partition or room divider and stop the stacking motion of the partition or room divider when a body passes between the leading panel of such partition or divider and a wall, or when a body is present in the stacking area of such partition or divider.</li>
					
</ol>

<p>Any person who disables or directs another person to disable any safety equipment required pursuant to this section shall be guilty of a violation punishable by not more than fifteen days imprisonment, or a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars, or both such fine and imprisonment.<br>
<h6>N.Y. Educ. Law § 409-F</h6></p>

<h5>Suggested Wall Partition Inspection Checklist:</h5>
			<ul>
<li>Remove Winch Set Screws and inspect key and keyway (If applicable)</li>
<li>Apply Loctite to set threads on set screw and re-install set screws.</li>
<li>Install 3/16 Roll Pin to assure that drive pipe will not dis-attach from winch.</li>
<li>Check all set screws, nuts and bolts on the motor/winch unit to ensure that none have worked loose.</li>
<li>Check each limit switch to ensure that it is working properly and that the screws are tight. Make adjustments as deemed necessary for proper operation.</li>

		<div class="topic-header">LIGHT TOWERS</div>
			<div class="text-content">
				<p>It is probably one of those things that you look at a lot, but probably do not give it much thought.  I’m here to tell you that if you haven’t put any attention towards your sports field light towers, you need to start doing so.  Most manufacturers recommend an annual visual inspection of light tower poles.</p>

<p>When I started as a Director of Facilities in September of 2009, the district that hired me had just removed all the light poles for their football field.  Earlier that year, it was discovered that poles manufactured by Whitco Co. LLP were failing and poles had come crashing down from Texas to Pennsylvania.  The Consumer Product Safety Commission had issued a recall for stadium light poles that may crack and fall, and the poles are our district were part of that recall.  Our poles had cracks around the welds at the pole bases.</p>

<p>Fast forward to November 1, 2019.  I get a call at 5:30am from my Custodian telling me a light pole had fallen down.  My first thought was  that a 10 foot sidewalk lamps had fallen.  When I started asking for more details, it ended up being a 90 foot light tower for the football field had fallen across the school road and just missed hitting the school.  The pole that had fallen was a pole that had replaced the defective Whitco pole.  You can see in the photo that the pole had a crack near the weld and this is clearly visible by the corrosion on the edge of the pole.  That day I contacted an architect who had a structural engineer on staff, and they sent him to do some testing on the poles.  When it was all said and done, we had poles with cracks on the football, baseball, and softball fields.  Within weeks, all the sports field light poles were removed.</p>
 

<p>A light tower falling down can do significant damage, and cause injury, even death.  I would perform visual inspection on your light poles at least once per year and would recommend doing them twice with one being before spring sports and the second before fall sports.  Light pole manufacturer’s recommend an annual inspection of the poles.  These inspection procedures include a magnaflux test and dye penetrant testing, along with visual inspections.  I would suggest you speak with your lighting manufacturer to determine the recommended inspection frequency and the type of testing to be done. </p> 
<h5>Visual Inspection Checklist</h5>
				<ul>
<li>Check the concrete base for cracks and erosion causing exposure of more of the base.</li>
<li>Mounting studs and nuts should be clean and rust free.</li>
<li>Look closely around the area where the tube of the light pole is welded to the mounting plate for corrosion, cracks, and flaking of the galvanized surface.</li>
<li>Any damage to the poles from being struck by equipment should be brought to the attention of a structural engineer.  Dents in the pole could increase the likelihood of failure.</li>
<li>Document your visual inspection.  Take and file photographs of any changes in conditions to the pole.</li>
<li>Any rust spots should be addressed immediately.  Contact your pole manufacturing company to see what paint should be used and what procedure must be done for surface preparation.</li>
<li>When you have a formal inspection by a structural engineer, be sure to get documentation and keep this on file. </li>

<div id="section-hoods" class="tab-content">
			
		<div class="topic-header">KITCHEN HOODS</div>
			<div class="text-content">
				<p>There are two types of commercial kitchen hoods: Type I, and Type II.  A Type I hood must always be used when the cooking process under the hood involves grease, deep fryers, and heavy smoke.  These hoods have welded stainless steel ductwork with welded seams.  A Type II hood is used where the hood is capturing water vapor.  These are used where the cooking involves boiling water and using warming ovens.  Architects typically specify a Type I hood for new installations or replacement work.  If the process of cooking under the hood changes, then having the Type I hood will not restrict how food can be prepared.</p> <br>
					
					<p>Most kitchen hoods should have a dry chemical type of system for suppressing any fires that occur under the hood area.  These systems are inspected twice per year and those documents must be kept for a 3-year period.  These systems are tested by qualified licensed personnel, which is typically the same vendor you use to perform inspections on your fire extinguishers.  Try to arrange your 6-month inspection schedule so this procedure does not interfere with kitchen operations. In addition to your school kitchens, you may also have these types of hoods in your concession stands and other locations.  Not all hoods have fire suppression systems.  Depending on the age of your kitchen equipment and the type of equipment that has been placed under the hood, you may not have a suppression system.  Look for nozzles protruding down from the hood and an activation button for the suppression system to verify you have this system.</p><br>
					
				<p>Per NYS Fire Code 607.3.3.3.1 <strong>Tags.</strong>  When a commercial kitchen hood or duct system is inspected, a tag containing the service provider name, address, telephone number and date of service shall be provided in a conspicuous location.  Prior tags shall be removed or covered.</p><br>  
					
				<p>You are also required to have your kitchen hoods cleaned every 6 months. This cleaning procedure should include the filters for the hood, the hood itself (both inside and outside surfaces), any grease collectors, and the fan for the hood.  Document the cleaning process and keep a record of the cleaning process.</p>

<div id="section-fireinspections" class="tab-content">
			
		<div class="topic-header">FIRE INSPECTION</div>
			<div class="text-content"><p>Every building owned, leased, or operated by a school district or BOCES must be inspected annually by a certified code enforcement official or building safety inspector (previously known as a code enforcement technician) using the NYSED Public School Building Fire Safety Report.  Annual fire safety inspections may not commence earlier than 45 days prior to the school’s annual due date.  NYSED will email a reminder to superintendents of schools that their annual inspection is due.  Although we call this an annual inspection, actual inspections occur every 11 months, which means inspections are not being held the same month each year.</p><br>
<p>The results of the annual fire safety inspection must be reported to the New York State Education Department (NYSED) via the secure NYSED Application Business Portal – Fire Safety application. The updated process includes an annual requirement that all school districts and BOCES verify the ownership and use for all buildings that are on the NYSED Fire Safety System. This process must take place prior to entering any Fire Safety Report data into the Portal. After all buildings have been verified, the annual inspection data can be entered.  Once the annual fire safety inspection has been successfully entered into the Portal, and the superintendent has certified the accuracy of the inspection data in the Portal, a certificate of occupancy will be automatically generated and will be available for printing by the school district or BOCES.  Unlike in the past, certificates of occupancy are not mailed from SED.</p><br>
				
<p>Fire inspection regions (previously known as zones) have been reconfigured to be consistent with previously identified zones in the SEDREF system.  The city school districts in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Yonkers have been integrated into the Fire Inspection Regions where these school districts are geographically located.
The annual fire safety inspection includes an entire existing building, exclusive of any addition which is under construction.  Once an addition has been completed, the designing architect or engineer must execute a Certification of Substantial Completion (FP-CSC) for the portion of the new building or addition proposed to be occupied.  Additionally, the entire building including the new space to be occupied must then be inspected by a certified code enforcement official or building safety inspector; after which the school district or BOCES must obtain a new certificate of occupancy for the entire building using the same process noted above.</p><br> 

	<p>Questions related to the Fire Safety Report or Certificates of Occupancy may be directed to the Office of Facilities Planning at 518-474-3906.</p><br>
				
<p>The slides for the changes made to entry of the fire inspection via the portal can be found at  <a href="http://www.p12.nysed.gov/facplan/documents/UpdatedFireSafetyProcessPresentation.pdf" target="new">http://www.p12.nysed.gov/facplan/documents/UpdatedFireSafetyProcessPresentation.pdf</a></p><br>


<h5>At the time of the inspection, please be sure to have the following available for review:</h5>
	<ul>
<li>Carbon Monoxide Alarm Inspection Testing &amp; Maintenance Records</li>
<li>Record of annual fire alarm system tests</li>
<li>Record of emergency light testing</li> 
<li>Elevator inspection certificate(s)</li>
<li>Record of Fire Extinguisher Inspections, including a map of the fire extinguisher locations and the type of extinguisher</li>
<li>Record of 6-month inspection of kitchen hood AES systems</li>
<li>Record of 6-month cleaning of kitchen hoods</li>
<li>Record of annual fire sprinkler system inspections &amp; tests</li>

<li>Record of annual hydrant(s) flow test if private</li>
<li>Record of testing &amp; maintenance of emergency and standby power systems, including building generators</li>
<li>Certificates are posted that indicate that each boiler has been inspected in compliance with Section 204 of the Labor Law (done every 2 years)</li>
<li>Records of inspection, testing &amp; maintenance of electrically operated partitions maintained on premises and available for inspection. NOTE: The inspection/testing/maintenance intervals are those recommended by the manufacturer.</li>
<li>Records of inspection, testing and maintenance of sliding and rolling fire doors.</li>
<li>Hazardous Materials Inventory &amp; SDS sheets.</li>
<li>Written Fire Safety Plan including evacuation procedures for evacuation of students who have disabilities or special needs.</li>
<li>Area of Refuge 2 Way Communication System testing</li>
<li>Grease Traps have been secured and signage has been added.  You should have a map/print showing the locations of all grease traps.</li>
<li>Verify that all doors can close and latch.</li>
<li>Emergency Rescue Window are all able to open easily and there is nothing blocking them.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>In addition to the items listed above, a few other points you should be aware of for fire safety are listed below.  Here is a link to the <a href="https://www.p12.nysed.gov/facplan/documents/PUBLICFireSafetyManual.pdf" target="new">Fire Code</a>, which details each nonconformance item in the NYSED fire report.</p>
				<ul>
<li>No combustible storage in mechanical, elevator control, boiler, and electrical rooms</li>
<li>Portable electric space heaters are UL Listed and have a tip over safety feature.  These must be plugged directly into an outlet and not an extension cord or power strip.  Note:  The addition of a heat source in a room will throw off your HVAC control for that room as it will sense an over temperature condition and try to cool the room down to the setpoint, defeating the purpose of the portable heater.</li>
<li>No material is to be stored within 24” of the ceiling.</li>
<li>No wall in a classroom can be covered with more than 50% of combustible materials (paper).</li>
<li>No paper on doors.</li>
<li>Windows for classrooms are no blocked and you can see into the classroom from the hallway.</li>
<li>No wedging of doors.</li>
					</ul><br>

<p>One thing you will surely be forced to deal with is what is affectionately called electrical outlet growth.  This is when items suddenly appear in classrooms that should not be there.  Those items include strings of lights or the now popular LED light tape, plug-in air fresheners, strip plugs, home appliances such as coffee makers, toasters and microwaves.  You will find many of the Amazon purchases are for items that are not UL Listed.  Make sure your district has a policy on what can be brought into classrooms and you will need to enforce these guidelines to adhere to the fire code.</p><br> 


<h5>Teachers should be aware of the following:</h5>
				<ul>
<li>Extension cords not in use, other than for temporary use.</li>
<li>Art work and teaching materials are limited to not more than 50% of the specific wall area to which they are attached.</li>
<li>Power strips have surge protection/circuit breaker, are not piggy backed into one another and are directly connected to receptacles (no extension cords).</li>
<li>Portable electric space heaters are UL approved, have a tip over safety switch &amp; are directly connected to a receptacle (not a power strip).</li>
<li>Curtains must have certification of flame treatment.</li>

		<div class="topic-header">BACKSTOPS (BASKETBALL BACKBOARDS)</div>
			<div class="text-content"><p>Backstops are the backboards for your basketball hoops and these need to be inspected annually.  If you have someone qualified on staff to do this, you can then perform this task inhouse, or you can use an outside company to perform this requirement.  Typically you will have a contractor who can perform this inspection along with your bleachers and powered partitions.  As with all required inspections, be sure you have documentation after the inspection has been completed and keep these records on file for 3 years.  Below is a checklist of a typical backstop inspection.</p><br>

<h5>Backstop Inspection:</h5>
				<ul>
<li>Examine cable drum on winch for excessive wear or looseness. Ensure cable is wrapping correctly and that cable stacking does not occur.</li>
<li>Check key switch operation. Make sure keys work properly, and that winches respond correctly. (If applicable)</li>
<li>Make sure winch is still properly anchored. Make sure anti-rotation bolts are installed.</li>
<li>Check cable sheaves for excessive wear or looseness. Make sure cable is still passing through the sheave.</li>
<li>Inspect cable clamps, aircraft cable, and safety belt for fraying or tears.</li>
<li>Make sure connection to backstop is secure, and that clamps are right in their original position.</li>
<li>Inspect safety belt structure attachment. Make sure bolts and clamps are still tight, and that the unit has not slipped.</li>
<li>Inspect backstop attachment and superstructure. Make sure all bolts and clamps are tight and have not shifted.</li>
<li>Check for cracks, corrosion, or other signs of damage/excessive wear.</li>
<li>Make sure back, front, and side braces are still at proper length, and that the jackknifes are folding correctly.</li>
<li>Assure that Jackknife set-screws are secured.</li>
<li>Check height adjuster for loose clamps and binding that keeps it from operating correctly.</li>
<li>Lubricate inner tubes of height adjusters.</li>
<li>Inspect bank and goal for cracks and bending.</li>
<li>Check that all hardware is present and not loose.</li>
<li>Make sure rim is still 10’ from the floor, level.</li>
<li>Check padding for tears, missing pieces, or loose sections.</li>

			<div class="text-content"><h5>Role of the Director of Facilities (DOF) and the Architect/Engineer (A/E)</h5><br>
				<p>
The primary role of the DOF is the offer support and district specific knowledge to the entire project team which includes the A/E.  The shared knowledge between the DOF and the entire project team, many times comprised of the superintendent, the business official, the construction manager, the architect and engineer is essential to ensure future success of your facilities.</p><br>
					
<h5>District Maintenance:</h5><p> It is appropriate for the DOF to have an ongoing relationship with their A/E as it pertains to maintenance of their facilities.  The DOF should utilize their A/E as a resource for appropriate maintenance improvements.  An example of this may be proper safety surfacing at the districts playgrounds, or the type of salt used on new concrete.  Building a relationship with the A/E spreads knowledge of district needs to the design professional ensuring future work is inclusive of deficiencies.  Often times districts utilize annual Capital Outlay Funding ($100,000) to complete work associated with maintenance needs.  The DOF should maintain a list of items that could be completed utilizing this funding source.</p>
	
<h5>Building Condition Survey (BCS):</h5><p>  It is essential the DOF communicate building deficiencies during the BCS phase to confirm sufficient dollars are appropriated for building system deficiencies to be incorporated in future capital work.  It is also appropriate for the DOF to be involved in discussions regarding long term district planning as it pertains to facility needs.  Items may include but are not limited to facilities: HVAC, electrical systems and lighting, security, roofing/windows/doors, athletic fields, building user needs, building maintenance needs, parking lots, site circulation (both bus and community), building access controls and technology systems, kitchen and cafeteria, building notification and sound systems as well as local community facility needs, ie Is the district deemed a Emergency shelter?</p>

<h5>Project Pre-Planning:</h5><p>  The DOF should be included in capital project pre-planning and scoping.  The DOF can bring valuable insight at this stage of the process to ensure proposed building needs are incorporated into the capital improvement project.</p> 

<h5>Project Planning and Schematic Level Design Phase:</h5><p>  The DOF’s role is needed to ensure the proposed capital project scope of work includes critical building deficiencies and found Health, Safety and Welfare items noted in the BCS.  The DOF should review the BCS recommendations against the proposed scope of work.  The DOF should also be included in project planning meetings (these may include board meetings, meetings with A/E, meetings with suppliers, etc) in order to prepare for and discuss future maintenance and user needs as it pertains to building(s) systems.  The DOF should review schematic level drawings, specifications and proposed equipment cut sheets against described project scope of work.  As an overall check, the DOF should review the voter approval language to ensure the authorized scope of work is consistent with that of the voter approval verbiage.</p> 

<h5>Capital Project Design Development Phase:</h5><p>  The DOF should confirm critical building needs will be included in the project or have a plan for future capital project work.  The DOF should work with their A/E to confirm building system improvements, maintenance of proposed systems, usability of proposed systems, lead times of proposed systems, warrantees, etc.  The DOF should consider how the proposed scope of work will change or effect their staff as well as other district staff.  The DOF should confirm decisions made in the schematic level design phase have been incorporated or noted as part of future improvements during regular design meetings.  The project team should be discussing project schedules at this point.</p> 

<h5>Capital Project Construction Document Phase:</h5><p>  The DOF should continue to be apart of project  meetings and discussions with their A/E about system types, manufacturers, design of systems and maintenance of systems, etc.  The DOF should confirm with other district users as needed (or if requested) to insure proposed systems are appropriate.  Ie. A DOF may discuss the type of wall pads proposed in the gym with the basketball coach or PE teachers.  Or the DOF might discuss the types of tables being proposed in the cafeteria with their staff that cleans them.  The DOF should be involved with discussions surrounding the project schedule.  The DOF’s insight is critical to the team when phasing projects, controlling access, etc.</p>

<h5>Capital construction phase:</h5><p>  The DOF or appointed staff often times serves as the day to day client  representative.  If the district appoints a clerk of the works or a construction manager to the project, the DOF should meet with them often to ensure security of the building during construction, access by contractors, special event access, safety of students and the general public, etc.  DOF should include themselves in construction meetings and walk with the A/E at critical times during the construction process.  The DOF should help the A/E and CM coordinate turn over of spaces, both before and at the end of improvements.  Work with A/E and CM to determine if there are contingency dollars available to be utilized before contractors demobilize.</p>

<h5>Post construction:</h5><p>  The DOF should maintain a relationship with their A/E professional for any post construction questions, user needs, system needs, etc.  The DOF should gather and maintain all construction manuals and as-built data from contractors.  The DOF should do a final walkthrough with A/E of critical work prior to district acceptance.  The DOF should ask their A/E to schedule a 11 month walkthrough.  The DOF shall give their A/E post occupancy feedback.  The DOF should develop a file of new warrantee information.</p>

		<div class="topic-header">CONSTRUCTION MANAGERS</div>
			<div class="text-content"><p>The role of the Construction Manager (CM), as it relates to the Capital Improvement Project Process, is one of support and collaboration between the School District Administration, Directors of Facilities, and their Design Professionals (A/E). Through all phases of Capital Projects, the CM serves as a vital liaison between Prime Contractors and the School District, their A/E as well as the District’s faculty and staff. From performance of document reviews and financials, to the on-site supervision of construction activities, the CM’s duties are to be performed in the interest of providing a successful project for the School District and the community at large. As a Director of Facilities, understanding the role of the CM during the execution of a Capital Project can help to ensure proper coordination of responsibilities and accountability for all parties involved. </p><br>
				
<p>During the Pre-Referendum and Pre-Construction Phases of a Capital Project, the CM’s role will include the review of construction documents, drafted by the School District’s Design Professionals, for completeness and constructability. In order to facilitate an accurate review of existing conditions relative to scheduled installations, the CM should request a review of As-Built Construction Documents from previous projects, the District’s Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) documentation, as well as any other information related to the presence of hazardous materials that may be encountered during construction. Throughout this document review process, the CM should meet frequently with the Director of Facilities in order to draw on their knowledge of their facility’s history and past improvements. The CM’s document reviews should include the survey and examination of all areas where construction activities are expected to be performed. Thorough examinations and documentation of existing pre-construction conditions are to be conducted. Upon the discovery of existing conditions which deviate from project documents under review, as well as any other discrepancies or omissions, the CM will notify the District’s A/E and request a response or modification of the documents, prior to the drafting of documents to be issued for bid. In addition to document reviews performed during the Pre-referendum and Pre-Construction Phases, the CM will facilitate or perform budget estimates of project documents.</p><br> 
				
<p>Prior to the issuance of Bid Documents for a Capital Project, the CM should seek information related to the School District’s and Facilities Department’s activities expected to take place during the Construction Phase of the Capital Project. The information that the CM should seek from appropriate channels include, but are not limited to:</p>
				<ul>
<li>Extra-Curricular Activities such as Athletic practices, tournaments, etc.</li>
<li>Planned Summer School and Summer Programs</li>
<li>Planned Maintenance Activities and the Facilities Department’s expected plan for performance of Summer  Cleaning, re-finishing of Gymnasium Floors, etc.</li>
<li>Identification of areas to use as “Swing-Space” which will allow for the performance of early work or the relocation of School District personnel or activities.</li>
<li>Identification of areas for interior and/or exterior storage and staging of construction materials and equipment.</li>
					</ul>
				
<p>Once furnished with this information, the CM will be responsible for the drafting and presentation of the Project Milestone Schedule and Phasing and Logistics Plans for approval by the School District, prior to these documents being included in the Project Documents. The Milestone Schedule includes dates for the expected progress and completion of construction activities. Phasing and Logistics Plans, which depict the areas to be affected by construction, may also be used to identify “Swing Space”, potential staging areas for construction materials and building access. In creating these documents, The CM is responsible for taking into consideration the School District’s scheduled activities, preferences and limitations. If the relocation of classrooms, offices or other spaces will be necessary to allow for construction activities, the CM is responsible for creating a Room Move Management Plan. In doing so, the CM should seek input from the School District regarding the storage of materials and accommodation of staff in specifically identified areas of a building(s). If desired by the School District, the CM is responsible for creating a Request for Proposal (RFP), seeking professional moving services from qualified firms. RFPs should include detailed information regarding how materials, equipment and furniture are to be moved, stored and ultimately relocated or returned. In addition to seeking professional moving services, the CM is responsible for the creation and distribution of RFPs for Special Inspection and, if necessary for the removal of Hazardous Materials, Asbestos Air Monitoring Services. Proposals received for the performance of all services, once reviewed by the CM, are to be presented to the School District Administration for review and approval as required.</p><br>
				
<p>During the Bidding Phase for each Capital Project, the CM’s role in support of the School District should be focused on ensuring that a favorable bid atmosphere can be attained prior to the scheduled Bid Date. The CM should work closely with the School District’s A/E to track the status of State Education Department of New York (NYSED) approval of Project Documents. Typically, all Project Documents are required to be approved by NYSED prior to bidding and award of contracts during a Capital Project. In addition, the CM is responsible for contacting potential bidders for each Contract (General, Mechanical, Electrical, etc.) in order to generate interest in the Capital Project. The CM should maintain and frequently update a database of contractors who they have worked successfully with in the past and/or contractors who are known to perform work in the general area of the Capital Project Site. Upon the release of Project Documents for review by potential bidders, the CM is responsible for arranging Pre-Bid site visits with contractors interested in viewing existing conditions and the Project Site. The CM is to serve as the primary point of contact in the scheduling of these site visits and shall meet with and escort contractors during their review. Once Bid Packages for each Contract are received, the CM is responsible for assisting the School District and their A/E in ensuring the accuracy and completeness of these bids. This process of “De-Scoping” involves the distribution of letters, which include questions related to the contractor’s inclusion of specific scope items and general requirements of each contract, to bidders for each contract. Once contracts are awarded for each contract, the CM and the School District’s A/E are responsible for the gathering of documents such as Insurance Certificates, Bonds and executed Contracts from each Prime Contractor. Prior to the beginning of scheduled construction activities, the CM’s responsibility is to maintain constant communication between the contractors, the School District and their Design Professionals. The CM, along with the District’s A/E will also be responsible for the review of Submittals (informational documents identifying materials, equipment and systems to be utilized and/or installed during a project). If approval of color or material samples by the School District is required as part of the Submittal Process, the CM will work with the School District’s A/E and contractors to facilitate the delivery of samples for review.</p><br>
				
<p>During the Construction Phase of a project, the CM will be responsible for daily on-site supervision and documentation of work performed by Prime Contractors and their Sub-Contractors. The CM will be responsible for directly interacting and communicating with contractors, the A/E and the School District in order to ensure that work performed meets the quality standards of the Project Documents and the Owner’s expectations. Documentation and photographing of existing conditions, construction activities and completed installations are one of the most important roles that a CM assumes as part of conducting on-site supervision. Ensuring the cleanliness and safety of project work sites is also within the CM’s responsibilities.  The CM should properly communicate to all on-site superintendents for each contractor how cleaning will be performed to theirs and the School District’s expectations.  In the event that deficiencies in work or deviations from the Project Documents are observed by the CM, it is their responsibility to inform the contractor performing the work, the A/E and if immediately necessary, the School District in order to ensure timely attention to these issues. Should conditions arise that would preclude a contractor from performing work or installations as described in the Project Documents, or if more information regarding the work is required, the CM is responsible for reviewing the situation with the contractor(s) to ascertain the solution. If the situation is above their qualification, experience or knowledge of the Project Documents, the CM is to encourage the contractor to submit a formal Request For Information (RFI) to the A/E for review and response by a qualified individual. Should an RFI response or other direction given by the A/E or the School District lead to a change in the manner in which installations are made or work is performed by a contractor, a Change Order, which enumerates a change in the amount of a prime contractor’s contract, will be issued by the A/E.  The CM, along with the A/E and the School District are responsible for the tracking and processing of Change Orders.</p><br>
				
<p>In order to properly control schedule and ensure that all parties involved are coordinating their work efficiently and as provided for in the Project Documents, the CM should hold weekly progress meetings with the on-site superintendents for each contractor performing work on-site. In addition to these weekly meetings, the CM is responsible for scheduling meetings with contractors prior to the beginning of certain activities which require advanced coordination or complex installations. An example of such a meeting would be a “Pre-Abatement Meeting”, during which all parties involved (CM, Asbestos Air Monitor, Hazardous Materials Contractor, and on occasion A/E) meet to discuss the contractor’s plan and schedule for abatement, required air sampling required in work areas and the impact that these removals may have on adjacent spaces and activities. In addition to meeting with contractors, the CM should conduct regularly scheduled meetings with the School District and their A/E in order to keep them apprised of progress and any potential issues that could affect the Project Schedule or the completion of any installations. These meetings, generally held on a monthly basis unless otherwise prescribed, are referred to as Owner, Architect, and Construction Manager Meetings (“OACM”). These OACM meetings are typically conducted throughout all phases of a Capital Project and are used as a venue to discuss all aspects (financial review, Phasing and Logistics, scheduling) of a project from the design phase to closeout.  The CM is responsible for providing progress reports as often as prescribed by the School District and/or their Board of Education.</p><br>
				
<p>Following the completion of construction activities, the CM is responsible for assisting the A/E in providing any documentation required for the closing out of all contracts. Included in these requirements, and of particular importance to the Facilities Director, are As-Built Drawings (Project Documents which depict the manner and location of installations and work performed during a Capital Project), Operation and Maintenance Manuals (O&amp;M), wherein all information related to installed products, finishes, equipment and materials are listed. The submission of these items, as well as Warranties for equipment and products installed, to the School District are all requirements provided for in the Project Documents for closeout of all contracts. The CM is also responsible for coordinating and scheduling with contractors for training to be provided on systems and equipment installed during a project to the School District’s Facilities Staff. The CM is responsible for ensuring that training for each system or piece of equipment is performed by qualified manufacturer’s representative and that the training is thorough, informative and documented. Should the Project Documents prescribed that a certain percentage of installed materials are to be provided to the School District for their use following the completion of construction activities, the CM is responsible for coordinating the delivery of such material, documenting the quantity provided and arranging it’s storage with the Director of Facilities. Once this “Turn-Over” or “Attic Stock” requirement is satisfied, the CM is responsible for providing a transmittal from the contractor providing the materials, which includes the quantity of materials provided, to the Director of Facilities for signature. In addition to the gathering and review of closeout documentation, the CM is responsible for ensuring the completion of items listed on Punch-Lists for each contract. Punch-List items, which are typically items which are incomplete or deficient, are identified by the A/E during their review of new installations and work performed by each contractor. The CM is responsible for tracking Punch-List items and coordinating with contractors for completion and correction of these items. Following the end of the Construction and Closeout Phases of a project, the CM can serve as a liaison between the School District, Director of Facilities and contractors. Should issues arise with installations and work performed during the project, the CM is responsible for reviewing and documenting on-site conditions with the Director of Facilities and their staff. If necessary, the CM is responsible for contacting the contractor(s) whose work is found deficient and arranging for remediation by the contractor(s), their subcontractors or a product’s manufacturer as prescribed by Warranty documents.</p><br>
				
<p>During the various phases of a Capital Project, the CM’s role should be to act in the best interests of the School District that they are serving. Beginning in the Pre-Construction Phase, the CM is responsible for, among other duties, ensuring completeness and accuracy of Project Documents in order to assist the School District in receiving favorable bids.  During Construction, the CM’s is responsible for supervising and documenting all work performed conforms to the expectations of the A/E and the School District. In the Closeout Phase of a project, one of the CM’s duties include the assurance that the School District and their Facilities Staff are provided with adequate training and information which will allow them to effectively utilize and maintain newly installed equipment and finishes. Following the end of construction and closeout phases of a project, the CM’s responsibility is to support the School District, Director of Facilities and the Facilities staff in maintaining their new and/or newly improved building, installations and equipment.</p><br>

		<div class="topic-header">SDS SAFETY DATA SHEETS</div>
			<div class="text-content">
				<p>Proper Safety Data Sheet management starts with having an up-to-date list of all the potentially toxic chemicals that you have in your district and to have that list organized.  A Safety Data Sheet, also referred to as an SDS, is a document that provides all the necessary information employees need to know with respect to chemicals they may contact within your district’s buildings.  The Safety Data Sheet is divided into sixteen sections and these sections cover the following:</p>
				<ul>
<li>Identification</li>
<li>Hazard(s) identification</li>
<li>Composition/information on ingredients</li>
<li>First-aid measures</li>
<li>Fire-fighting measures</li>
<li>Accidental release measures</li>
<li>Handling and storage</li>
<li>Exposure controls/personal protection</li>
<li>Physical and chemical properties</li>
<li>Stability and reactivity</li>
<li>Toxicological information</li>
<li>Ecological information</li>
<li>Disposal considerations</li>
<li>Transport information</li>
<li>Regulatory information</li>
<li>Other information</li>
					
		</ul><br>

<p>Safety Data Sheets are required to be kept and available to all staff for every chemical you have at your district.  Managing this endeavor can be quite a task.  Safety Data Sheets are one of the first things an auditor/inspector may look for when checking if you are following regulations.  Many of us have binders in our building main offices, but they may not always have the latest version of these documents.  Many districts have gone to an electronic format for storing their SDS documents.  As noted in the required training section, all new staff members are to be trained on the Right To Know within 60 days of being hired and then again annually.</p><br>  
<p>If your Safety Data Sheets are stored electronically, they must be accessible without the need for a password.  You also need to have an SDS Management Plan in place.  There is an example of a plan attached and a link to the file so you can download and edit it for your district if you do not have one.  Below is a link to the OSHA website with a document that explains how to read and understand the sixteen sections of a Safety Data Sheet.  This is covering in annual training, but it is a good reference in case you are asked questions on a Safety Data Sheet.</p><br>
				
<p>Non-toxic chemicals do not require an SDS.  Unfortunately, there are very few chemicals that we use that do not have some type of hazard associated with them.  Aside from water and beverages, you will need an SDS for about everything else.</p><br>  
				<p>There are a few things that you must be cognizant of with respect to your SDS program.</p>
				<ul>
<li>You must have a SDS for every potentially toxic chemical you have on site at your district.</li>
<li>Safety Data Sheets must be readily accessible by all the staff at your district.</li>
<li>Safety Data Sheets should be organized in such a manner that they are easy to access and locate a specific SDS.</li>
<li>It is strongly recommended that you also keep a hard copy of all the Safety Data Sheets in case the electronic version becomes unavailable.</li>
<li>If you are using binders and hard copies of the Safety Data Sheets, it is strongly recommended to have binders located near known hazardous chemicals, such as your custodial closets.  These binders can contain just the SDS for the chemicals in that specific area.</li>
<li>As part of your annual training sessions with your staff, reviewing SDS information for chemicals they use is good practice.</li>
					<li>Record SDS reviews by noting which chemicals were reviewed and who attended the session.</li>

		<div class="topic-header">REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE</div>
			<div class="text-content">
				<p>New York State’s Regulated Medical Waste Program (RMW) is jointly administered by the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC).  The DEC has supervisory authority for all storage, handling and destruction processes located at facility sites not under the jurisdiction of the DOH for offsite transportation of RMW, for all generators, monitoring, responding to illegal disposal incidents, and for all external storage. In accordance with federal and state requirements, RMW (excluding medical sharp waste) should be placed in a red biohazard plastic bag and then in a disposable package (such as a cardboard box) or reusable rigid leakproof container to ensure containment.</p>
					
<p>When the regulated medical waste is collected by a third-party carrier, the waste is sent to an approved transport facility or a directly approved processing facility.</p> 
				
<p>Schools can generate a variety of Regulated Medical Wastes (RMW) from staff/student by the way of  EpiPens, diabetes management devices, broken glass, and medication. These wastes should not be mixed with regular trash, and they must be disposed of according to federal, state, and local regulations.  Not only must they be disposed of properly, but you must document their removal and keep these records on file.</p>
				
<p>Most, if not all the RMW will come from the nurse’s office.  As stated, you will have sharps (needles) from insulin injections, and EpiPens, along with materials that may have been used for a bleeding student (gauze pads, bandages, tissue, etc) which all need to be disposed of properly.  There are a few ways to dispose of these products, and to store them until disposal.  Note that feminine hygiene products used to absorb menstrual flow are not considered RMW per OSHA.</p>
				
<h4>Medical Waste Container</h4>
 <p>Many districts may place a Medical Waste Container in the nurse’s office to hold the regulated waste until it is removed from the premises.  The containers for RMW are typically red in color or at least have a large red identification label on them.  Most containers require a special RMW bag to be used with them, which is also red in color.  The red bags and red containers are there to throw up a warning for anyone who may handle these containers.</p>  

<h4>Storage of Medical Waste</h4>
<p>Once you remove medical waste from the area of generation (Nurse’s Office), you can store the waste for up to 60 days if you generate less than 50 pounds of RMW per month, otherwise you are permitted to store RMW for 30 days.  If it is a sharps container, it should be sealed before moving it to storage.  The waste in the red biohazard bags should be tied or sealed as well.  You can place the sealed sharps container inside the red biohazard bag.  The storage area must have restricted access and should have a Biohazard warning sign on the door.  The surfaces that hold the medical waste shall be smooth and easily cleanable.  The waste can not be placed on carpet or rough cement that is not sealed.  The surface and the storage area should be impervious to water.  If the storage area is located outside the building (storage shed), then it must be locked and must display biohazard warning symbols.  It must also be watertight with no danger of any liquid penetrating into the ground.</p>

<h4>Removal of Medical Waste</h4>
<p>Your district is required to properly dispose of medical waste and to document this action.  There are a number of contractors who perform this task, and you can check with other districts within your NYSSFA Chapter as to which vendor they use for this.  Pricing to remove RMW can vary quite a bit between vendors.  The company who removes your NRW must provide you with a copy of the REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE TRACKING FORM (see example form).  This form will show the type of container removed, the number of containers, and the volume of waste removed in addition to other information.</p>
				
<h5>Record Keeping</h5>
	
<p>Per the Department of Health, the following is what is required for record keeping.</p>
 <h5>70-2.5 Record keeping.</h5><br> 
<p>(a) A record of regulated medical waste by quantity and categories as defined in Public Health Law 1389-aa and for disposition of treated waste on-site shall be maintained and retained on-site by the generator for three (3) years from the date of disposition of the waste, and shall be available for inspection and copying by the Department. Documentation of corrective action related to a commingling incident shall be retained three (3) years.</p>
<p>(b) A report of the regulated medical waste generated annually, by quantities and categories as defined in Public Health Law 1389-aa shall be submitted to the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation upon request.</p>
<h4>Regulated Medical Waste Plan</h4>
<p>You are to have a plan for your Regulated Medical Waste, just like you have a plan for Safety Data Sheets and AHERA.  Below you will find the link to a plan that will just need to fill in the blanks.  Instructions are included.  There is also a link to a completed plan with some comments to assist you.

<p>Here is the link to the template to use to create your Medical Waste Plan.</p>

<h4><center>Medical Waste – DEC Information</center></h4>
<h5><center>NYS Department of Environmental Conservation - 6 NYCRR Part 364</center></h5>
<h5><center><em>Effective Date - December 7, 1988</em></center></h5><br>

<p>Under the New York Environmental Conservation Law, the Department of Environmental Conservation’s Division of Solid and Hazardous Materials (518-457-6934) / (Medical Waste 518-485-8394) regulates and requires the proper onsite and offsite handling, treatment, and disposal of medical wastes from all generators other than hospitals, clinical laboratories, and residential health care facilities.  Any medical waste generated in school districts is covered under this Regulation.</p>

<h4>COMPLIANCE ISSUES</h4>
				<ul>
<li>Medical waste generators must properly segregate, handle, store, and arrange for the transportation and disposal of medical waste.</li>
<li>Medical wastes must be segregated into three classes:  sharps, fluids, and other regulated medical wastes.  If regulated wastes are mixed in with other waste, then it is all considered regulated medical waste.</li> 
<li>Sharps must be stored in leak-proof, rigid, puncture-resistant red containers; all other medical wastes must be stored in strong, moisture-impervious red bags.</li>
<li>All containers must be labeled “REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE”.</li>
<li>Prior to disposal, medical waste must be stored so as to prevent decay.  Access to storage areas must be limited to authorized personnel.</li>
<li>If a generator does not destroy waste on-site, it must arrange for transportation of waste to a treatment and disposal facility using a DEC-permitted transporter (red bag hauler). </li> 
<li>Small Quantity Generators (generate and dispose of less than 50 pounds of regulated medical waste per month) may ship their own waste, provided they first register with the DEC.</li>
<li>Large Quantity Generators (generate and dispose of more than 50 pounds of regulated medical waste per month) must hire a “medical waste hauler” who holds a current New York State DEC permit to transport regulated medical wastes to a licensed treatment/disposal facility.</li>
<li>Medical waste bound for off-site transport must be labeled on the outside with the name and address of the generator, the name, address, and permit number of the transporter, the date of shipment, and identification of the contents as regulated medical waste.  Inner containers must be labeled with the generator’s name and address.</li>
<li>A NYS Medical Waste Tracking Form must be used to ensure that the regulated medical waste is transported, treated, and disposed of in compliance with DEC regulations.</li>
<li>Tracking forms must be signed by the generator, transporters, and the destination facility operator, and must be retained by the generator for at least three years.</li>
					</ul><br>

<h4>TRAINING REQUIREMENTS</h4>
				<ul>
<li>Training of medical care providers and custodial and maintenance staff in the proper handling and disposal of medical waste is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  See OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.1030 - Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens.</li>
					</ul>

		<div class="topic-header">ROOFING</div>
			<div class="text-content">
				<p>Roofing is not a required inspection by SED, however, we feel this is a necessary and critical task.  It is one of those things that we tend to ignore until we have problems, such as a leak.  Knowing what type of roof you have is the first step.  Below are the roofing systems we typically see in New York on school buildings.  We encourage you to watch the roofing video in the TRAINING VIDEOS section.</p>
				
				<img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/roofing-1.jpg" class="center" width="750" height="336" alt=""/>
				<h4>EPDM Roofing- Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer</h4>
				<p>This is the common black rubber roof we find on a lot of school buildings.</p>
				<img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/roofing-2.png" width="750" height="336" alt="" class="center">
				<h4>PVC Roofing - Polyvinyl Chloride</h4><br>
				<img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/roofing-3.jpg" width="750" height="336" alt="" class="center">
				<h4>TPO Roofing - Thermoplastic Polyolefin</h4>
				<img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/roofing-4.jpg" width="750" height="336" alt="" class="center">
				<h4>Modified Asphalt Roof - (Styrene-Butadiene-Strene)</h4>
				<img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/roofing-5.jpg" width="750" height="336" alt="" class="center">
				<h4>Gravel BUR Roof - Built Up Roofing</h4>
				<img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/roofing-6.jpg" width="750" height="336" alt="" class="center">
				<h4>Roof Coating - Silicone, Poly-Urethane and Acrylic</h4><br><br>
				<h4>MAINTENANCE ITEMS</h4>
				<p>It is recommended to walk all roof areas a minimum of every 6 months to keep up on maintenance items. A list of common maintenance items are below.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Keep drains clear of dirt and debris. Check that all drain baskets and fasteners are secure.</li>
					<li>Keep tree branches trimmed back from roof edges</li>
					<li>Remove any unused items on the roof</li>
					<li>Report any loose flashings (Corners or edges pealing up)</li>
					<li>Report any leaks promptly</li>
					<li>Report any damaged edge metal and counter flashing</li>
					<li>Report loose seams in membranes or loose corners on flashings.</li>
					<li>Avoid any petroleum products around roof membrane</li>
					<li>Provide and use walkway pads when walking on the roof. Exercise caution when not walking on walkway pads. Membranes are slippery when wet.</li>
					<li>Do not use roof cement on single ply roofing (EPDM, TPO, and PVC) or coatings as a repair.</li>
					<li>Check caulk on terminations and fasteners. Use an elastomeric caulk for repairs and touch ups.</li><br>

				<p div class="foottext">The preceding care and maintenance requirements are for Sure-Seal , Sure-White , Sure-Weld , Sure-Flex and FleeceBACK  Membrane Roofing Systems. The list is not meant to be exhaustive and is for illustrative purposes only. Carlisle recommends that your maintenance staff and/or maintenance contractor inspect the roof periodically or at least twice a year. The inspection should concentrate on high-risk areas such as roof hatches, drains and around all rooftop equipment as well as general inspection of the entire roof. The inspector should be looking for membrane damage (cuts and tears), oil or Freon leaks, chemical spills or water infiltration into the roofing system.<br>
				Compliance with the above-listed care and maintenance requirements will aid in ensuring a durable, watertight membrane roofing system.</p>

			<div class="text-content">
				
				
<p>Not all Risk Management (insurance companies) are alike.  Some offer special programs for their subscribers and visit your district on an annual basis, while others offer limited services on an as needed basis.  Insurers of public schools will generally conduct inspections of these facilities annually to ensure they are being maintained and no significant hazards are present. Some Risk Management representatives will conduct an annual inspection to help their members provide a safe environment for students, staff, and visitors, and to assist districts/BOCES in protecting their physical assets.</p>

		<div class="topic-header">BUSINESS PARTNERS - SUPPORTERS OF THE NYSSFA</div>
			<div class="text-content">
				<p>This should arguably be the first topic listed on our table of contents, becasue without our Business Partners, we would not be able to do our jobs.  Business partners are a financial and educational resource that support NYSSFA at the state and/or local level. Their support is key to funding several SFA events throughout the year as well as being a professional development resource for members.</p>
				
<p>At the state level business partners financial support is a major contributor of the annual fall conference as well as Leadership Weekend, Advocacy Day, and the semi-annual Leadership Academies.  At the local level business partners support annual golf tournaments, custodial trade shows/workshops and monthly professional development meetings.</p>  
<p>The business partner program is outlined at the state level in the Investment Opportunities Prospectus (PROVIDE LINK OR ATTACH PDF).  The Key Supporter Program is the highest level of support with sponsor benefits at events throughout the year.  There are also additional levels of sponsorship available for the annual conference (Diamond, Gold, Silver, and Bronze).  Any questions about the business partner program are coordinated by state level leaders.</p>
				
<p>Many business partners support the regional SFA chapters.  Each chapter establishes its sponsorship/membership level of commitment. Typically, the fee for a local chapter Business Partner is much less and usually a small annual fee to attend most meetings. In addition, there is tiered pricing to sponsor the local events.</p>
				
<p>Please note that depending on a company’s geographic reach they may be a state and/or local level sponsor.  (i.e., A state only level supporter may have a national presence vs.  a chapter only supporter may a small local company with limited geographic presence).  No matter the level of support, the partners are a resource that should be utilized when evaluating the needs of your district.  Business partners can be a professional development resource and can provide education programs, training sessions and information webinars related to their area of expertise.</p>

				<h5>Facilities Planning Office Introduction</h5>
				
				<p>The Office of Facilities Planning (OFP), on behalf of the Commissioner, is the code enforcement authority for public schools, BOCES, and charter schools that were chartered after 7/31/10.  In accordance with Department of State regulation Title 19, 1201.2(e), The State Education Department shall be accountable for administration and enforcement of the Uniform Code with respect to buildings, premises and equipment in the custody of, or activities related thereto undertaken by, school districts and Boards of Cooperative Educational Services.</p>
				
<p>Accordingly, all plans and specifications for the erection, repair, enlargement or remodeling of school buildings in any public-school district in the State, outside of New York City, must be reviewed and approved by the Commissioner.  The OFP performs this function through the issuance of a building permit. However, the OFP offers services beyond the approval of plans and specifications. We offer advice and technical assistance to school districts, architects and engineers to help them solve their school building needs with consideration of educational and planning efficiency, conservation of natural resources, initial and life-cycle costs within the context of the most recent State and Federal laws.</p>

<p>The link below includes a document detailing the permit process. Authored in 2002 it remains significantly accurate, but please note that some parts of the instruction guide in the link below may have been superseded. It is a valuable read to get acquainted with the process. Less detailed information is also shown below.</p>       <p><a href="https://www.p12.nysed.gov/facplan/publicat/BP_instruction_guide.PDF" target="new">https://www.p12.nysed.gov/facplan/publicat/BP_instruction_guide.PDF</a></p> 

				<h5>When is a Building Permit Required?</h5>
<h5>Reference Guide #B.3</h5>
<h5>March 9, 1999 (rev. July 2015) (rev. May 2019)</h5>
<p>The Office of Facilities Planning reviews plans and specifications and issues building permits for capital construction projects undertaken by public school districts and BOCES.  Frequently, the Office is asked if a particular type of project requires such review, approval, and issuance of a building permit.  This article defines which projects do and which projects do not require a building permit.  There is no question that new buildings, additions, and reconstruction projects require a building permit.  The question usually arises with regard to specific types of work and smaller kinds of facilities.</p>
				
<p>New York State Department of State Regulations (19 NYCRR Chapter 32 Part 1203.3) which implement the Uniform Code state that "Building permits shall be required for work which must conform to the Uniform Code."  The Building Code of New York State Section 101.2 enumerates the many types of work to which the Code applies. The very broad scope work listed would imply that any capital construction project would require a building permit. However, because certain categories of work may be excluded from the requirement for a building permit as noted in 19 NYCRR Chapter 32 Part 1203.3, this is not the case.  By applying these exceptions and adhering to Building Code Section 101.2 the following list of project types which require building permits is derived.
Where a building permit is required, the usual procedure for a typical capital construction project submission to the Office applies, except where noted otherwise.</p>
				
<h4>PROJECTS WHICH REQUIRE A BUILDING PERMIT:</h4>
				<ul>
<li>New buildings, additions, and reconstruction projects.</li>
<li>Press boxes, concession stands, toilet facilities, permanent greenhouses, storage/utility buildings, dugouts which include a storage room, guard booths, and similar structures.  (NOTE: For storage/utility buildings, dugouts which include a storage room, guard booths, and ticket booths not exceeding a total gross floor area of 200 square feet, a full submission will not be required.  It will only be necessary to follow the procedure which applies when using Form FP-AU Request for Approval of Use of a Facility.)</li>
<li>Bleacher and grandstand projects which involve footings, piers, foundations and/or concrete slabs.  (NOTE: Bleacher or grandstands constructed in conjunction with a building or site project, will be reviewed and a building permit issued for the whole project.)</li>
<li>Pavilions, Bandstands, Membrane Structures, and similar structures.</li>
<li>Site lighting and outdoor electric, such as field lighting and scoreboards - including supports and electrical hookup.</li>
<li>Small types of projects which affect health and safety (ex: means of egress; new or altered fire/safety, electrical and/or mechanical systems).</li>
<li>Site development which is in conjunction with a building project, and for which plans and specifications are submitted together with those for the building project will be reviewed and a building permit issued for the whole project.</li>
<li>Playground projects which involve on-site construction of various features and structures (ex: retaining walls; footings; walkways; grading/drainage).</li>
<li>Irrigation projects.</li>
<li>Site work which involves earth moving; utilities; or storm water systems.</li>
<li>Demolition of existing buildings.</li>
		</ul><br>			
					
<h4>PROJECTS WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE A BUILDING PERMIT:</h4>
				<ul>
<li>Small site development - including finished grading and planting; fencing; and re-paving of existing roadways, parking lots and walkways.</li>
<li>Bleacher projects which involve only the installation of pre-engineered, factory-built equipment without foundations or sitework.</li>
<li>Playground projects which involve only the installation of pre-engineered factory-built equipment without sitework.</li>
	</ul><br>				
					
<p>In those cases which do not require a building permit, the Board of Education is responsible to ensure conformance with the Uniform Code, the Commissioner's Regulations Part 155 and the Manual of Planning Standards.</p>
<p>If there are any questions as to what work does, or does not require a building permit, contact the Office of Facilities Planning -- (518) 474-3906.</p>

Westlaw access to 155 regulations</li>
					</ul><br>

<h5>Permit Application Submission Process:</h5>
				<ul>
<li>The majority of Districts utilize their Architect / Engineer firm to develop and submit permit applications.</li> 
<li>The process begins with the Letter of Intent: https://www.p12.nysed.gov/facplan/articles/UseLOI1.html (copied below)</li>
					</ul><br>

<h3>Procedures for Letter of Intent (LOI) Requests</h3>
<p>Due to the large number of requests for project control numbers, all school districts and BOCES should submit requests for project numbers using the <a href="https://www.p12.nysed.gov/facplan/documents/LOI_Forms_Workbook.xls" target="new">Letter of Intent (LOI) Workbook</a>   which is available on our website.</p>
<p>The LOI Workbook contains forms for the following types of projects:</p>
				<ul>
<li>Smart Schools Bond Act projects</li>
<li>New Construction projects</li>
<li>Reconstruction and/or Addition projects</li>
<li>Charter School projects</li>
<li>Leased Space or Discovered Building projects</li>
<li>Manufactured Building projects</li>
<li>District-Wide projects</li>
			</ul><br>		
					
<p>The forms are designed to speed up the process of issuing project control numbers by requesting pertinent and accurate information needed to enter the project into our system. Requests that are sent without using these forms or projects submitted without proper project control numbers being issued will result in unnecessary delays.</p>
				
<p>When the LOI forms are completed correctly, they are able to be quickly processed and initial response letters can then be returned to the school district or BOCES in the most timely manner.</p>
				
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Letter of Intent Forms should be submitted via email to <a href="mailto:emscfp@nysed.gov">emscfp@nysed.gov</a>.  Please DO NOT send a hard copy by mail.  It is not necessary to send a cover letter, simply email the LOI form itself.</p>
	
	<ul>
<li>When the design of the project is 100% complete and ‘ready to bid’, the permit application is submitted to OFP. Each drawing/ spec/ form/ paperwork must contain the Project Number that was assigned via the LOI process.</li>
<li>The Paperwork / Form portion of the submission must be submitted via mailed hard copy AND electronically. The workbook of required Paperwork items, as well as a newly developed guidebook are available here:  <a href="https://www.p12.nysed.gov/facplan/documents/Final_Submission_Forms_Workbook1-31-2022_006.xls" target="new">https://www.p12.nysed.gov/facplan/documents/Final_Submission_Forms_Workbook1-31-2022_006.xls</a>  (the workbook will automatically download and is an excel document) <a href="https://www.p12.nysed.gov/facplan/FinalSubmissionFormsWorkbookPP11-22-2021.pptx" target="new">https://www.p12.nysed.gov/facplan/FinalSubmissionFormsWorkbookPP11-22-2021.pptx</a> (the guidebook will automatically download and is a powerpoint document)</li><br>

		</ul>

<h5>Review Process:</h5>
				<ul>
<li>Once a complete submission of paperwork/drawings/specifications has been received, a 6 digit Review Number is assigned to the project.</li> 
<li>The OFP reviewers work in order of receipt and the length of their queue is published on the OFP website for reference.</li>
<li>There are three types of OFP reviewers:</li>
	<ul>
<li>Architect</li>
<li>Engineer</li>
<li>Fiscal Associate</li>
	</ul>
<li>The scope of the work dictates if it requires both A and E reviews, but all projects receive an FA review.</li> 
<li>There is often a need for corrections/ revisions/ addendums and those are accomplished typically between the A/E firm and the OFP reviewers. The District contact is copied on the correspondence.</li>  
<li>Upon approval of the complete application permit submission, OFP will issue a building permit subject to the following qualifications:</li>
<li>(i) During construction, the project shall be properly supervised by a licensed architect or engineer.</li>
<li>(ii) The building permit may be revoked by the commissioner in the event of violations of the State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code (9 NYCRR Parts 600 through 1250), regulations 155.5 or other safety standards imposed by law or regulation.</li>
<li>The permit must be posted during construction.</li> 
<li>OFP is not typically involved in the construction process since the responsibility for oversight during construction is granted to the A/E.</li> 
<li>It is essential that the District / BOCES / School understand the rules regarding health and safety during construction. So essential that the Regulations 155.5 are copied here for review and reference:</li> 
					
				</ul><br>
				
<h3><center>155.5 Uniform Safety Standards for School Construction and Maintenance Projects</center></h3><br>
<h5>(a) Monitoring of construction and maintenance activities.</h5>
				
<p>The occupied portion of any school building shall always comply with the minimum requirements necessary to maintain a certificate of occupancy and shall be monitored during construction or maintenance activities for safety violations by school district personnel. It is the responsibility of the board of education or board of cooperative educational services to assure that these standards are continuously maintained when the building or any portion thereof is occupied.</p>
				
<h5>(b) Investigation and disposition of complaints relating to health and safety received as a result of construction and maintenance activities.</h5>
<p>Boards of education and boards of cooperative educational services shall follow procedures established under section 155.4(d)(7) of this Part.</p>
				
<h5>(c) Pre-construction testing and planning for construction projects.</h5>
				<ol>
				
<li>Boards of education and boards of cooperative educational services shall assure that proper planning is made for safety of building occupants during construction. For all construction projects for which bids are issued on or after September 30, 1999, such boards shall assure that safety is addressed in the bid specifications and contract documents before contract documents are advertised for bid. All school areas to be disturbed during renovation or demolition shall be tested for lead and asbestos. Appropriate procedures to protect the health of building occupants shall be included in the final construction documents for bidding.</li>
<li>Boards of education and boards of cooperative educational services shall establish procedures for involvement of the health and safety committee to monitor safety during school construction projects. The health and safety committees in school districts other than in cities with one million inhabitants or more shall be expanded during construction projects to include the project architect, construction manager, and the contractors. Such committee shall meet periodically to review issues and address complaints related to health and safety resulting from the construction project. In the case of a city school district in a city of one million inhabitants or more, the board of education shall submit procedures for protecting health and safety during construction to the commissioner for approval. Such procedures shall outline methods for compliance with this section.</li>
<li>The district emergency management plan shall be updated to reflect any changes necessary to accommodate the construction process, including an updated emergency exit plan indicating temporary exits required due to construction. Provisions shall be made for the emergency evacuation and relocation or release of students and staff in the event of a construction incident.</li>
<li>Fire drills shall be held to familiarize students and staff with temporary exits and revised emergency procedures whenever such temporary exits and revised emergency procedures are required.</li>
					
					</ol><br>
				
<h5>(d) Pre-construction notification of construction projects.</h5>
<p>The board of education or board of cooperative educational services shall establish procedures for notification of parents, staff and the community in advance of a construction project of $10,000 or more to be conducted in a school building while the building is occupied. Such procedures shall provide notice at least two months prior to the date on which construction is scheduled to begin, provided that in the case of emergency construction projects, such notice shall be provided as far in advance of the start of construction as is practicable. Such notice shall include information on the district's obligations under this section to provide a safe school environment during construction projects. Such notice requirement may be met by publication in district newsletters, direct mailings, or holding a public hearing on the project to inform parents, students, school personnel and community members.</p>
				
<h5>(e) General safety and security standards for construction projects.</h5>
				<ol>
<li>All construction materials shall be stored in a safe and secure manner.</li>
<li>Fences around construction supplies or debris shall be maintained.</li>

<li>During exterior renovation work, overhead protection shall be provided for any sidewalks or areas immediately beneath the work site or such areas shall be fenced off and provided with warning signs to prevent entry.</li>
<li>Workers shall be required to wear photo identification badges at all times for identification and security purposes while working at occupied sites.</li>
					
		</ol><br>			
<h5>(f) Separation of construction areas from occupied spaces.</h5>
				
<p>Construction areas which are under the control of a contractor and therefore not occupied by district staff or students shall be separated from occupied areas. Provisions shall be made to prevent the passage of dust and contaminants into occupied parts of the building. Periodic inspection and repairs of the containment barriers must be made to prevent exposure to dust or contaminants. Gypsum board must be used in exit ways or other areas that require fire rated separation. Heavy duty plastic sheeting may be used only for a vapor, fine dust or air infiltration barrier, and shall not be used to separate occupied spaces from construction areas.</p>
				<ol><br>
				
<li>A specific stairwell and/or elevator should be assigned for construction worker use during work hours. In general, workers may not use corridors, stairs or elevators designated for students or school staff.</li>
<li>Large amounts of debris must be removed by using enclosed chutes or a similar sealed system. There shall be no movement of debris through halls of occupied spaces of the building. No material shall be dropped or thrown outside the walls of the building.</li>
<li>All occupied parts of the building affected by renovation activity shall be cleaned at the close of each workday. School buildings occupied during a construction project shall maintain required health, safety and educational capabilities at all times that classes are in session.</li>
					
			</ol><br>		
<h5>(g) Maintaining exiting and ventilation during school construction projects.</h5>
<p>The following information shall be included in all plans and specifications for school building projects:</p>
				<ol>
<li>A plan detailing how exiting required by the applicable building code will be maintained during construction. The plan shall indicate temporary construction required to isolate construction equipment, materials, people, dust, fumes, odors, and noise during the construction period. Temporary construction details shall meet code-required fire ratings for separation and corridor enclosure. At a minimum, required exits, temporary stairs, ramps, exit signs, and door hardware shall be provided at all times.</li>
					
					</ol><br>
<p>A plan detailing how adequate ventilation will be maintained during construction. The plan shall indicate ductwork which must be rerouted, disconnected, or capped in order to prevent contaminants from the construction area from entering the occupied areas of the building. The plan shall also indicate how required ventilation to occupied spaces affected by construction will be maintained during the project.</p>
				
<h5>(h) Fire and hazard prevention.</h5>
<p>Areas of buildings under construction that are to remain occupied shall maintain a certificate of occupancy. In addition, the following shall be strictly enforced:</p>
				<ol>
<li>No smoking is allowed on public school property, including construction areas.</li>
<li>During construction daily inspections of district occupied areas shall be conducted by school district personnel to assure that construction materials, equipment or debris not block fire exits or emergency egress windows.</li>
<li>Proper operation of fire extinguishers, fire alarm, and smoke/fire detection systems shall be maintained throughout the project.</li>
					
					</ol><br>
<h5>(i) Noise abatement during construction and maintenance activities.</h5>
<p>Construction and maintenance operations shall not produce noise in excess of 60 dba in occupied spaces or shall be scheduled for times when the building or affected building spaces are not occupied or acoustical abatement measures shall be taken. Noise level measurements (dba) shall be taken with a type 2 sound level meter in the occupied space in a location closest to the source of the noise. Complaints regarding excessive noise shall be addressed through the health and safety committee. The district should anticipate those times when construction noise is unacceptable and incorporate “no work” periods into the bid specifications.</p>
				
<h5>(j) Control of chemical fumes, gases, and other contaminants during construction and maintenance projects.</h5>
<p>The bid specifications and construction contracts for each construction project shall indicate how and where welding, gasoline engine, roofing, paving, painting or other fumes will be exhausted. Care must be taken to assure fresh air intakes do not draw in such fumes.</p>
				<ol>
<li>The bid specifications shall require schedules of work on construction and maintenance projects which include time for off-gassing of volatile organic compounds introduced during construction before occupancy is allowed. Specific attention is warranted for activities including glues, paint, furniture, carpeting, wall coverings, and drapery. Manufacturers shall be contacted to obtain information regarding appropriate temperatures and times needed to cure or ventilate the product during use and before safe occupancy of a space can be assured. Building materials or furnishings which off-gas chemical fumes, gases, or other contaminants shall be aired out in a well ventilated heated warehouse before it is brought to the project for installation or the manufacturer's recommended off-gassing periods must be scheduled between installation and use of the space. If the work will generate toxic gases that cannot be contained in an isolated area, the work must be done when school classes and programs are not in session. The building must be properly ventilated and the material must be given proper time to cure or off-gas before re-occupancy.</li>
<li>Manufacturer's material safety data sheets (MSD) shall be maintained at the site for all products used in the project. MSDS must be provided to anyone who requests them. MSDS indicate chemicals used in the product, product toxicity, typical side effects of exposure to the product and safe procedures for use of the product.</li>
					
					</ol><br>
<h5>(k) Asbestos abatement protocols.</h5>
				
<p>All asbestos abatement projects shall comply with all applicable Federal and State laws including but not limited to the New York State Department of Labor industrial code rule 56 (12 NYCRR 56), and the Federal Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA), 40 CFR part 763 (Code of Federal Regulations, 1998 Edition, Superintendent of Public Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402; 1998; available at the Office of Facilities Planning, Education Building Annex, Room 1060, State Education Department, Albany, NY 12234). Large and small asbestos projects as defined by 12 NYCRR 56 shall not be performed while the building is occupied. Minor asbestos projects defined by 12 NYCRR 56 as an asbestos project involving the removal, disturbance, repair, encapsulation, enclosure or handling of 10 square feet or less of asbestos or asbestos material, or 25 linear feet or less of asbestos or asbestos material may be performed in unoccupied areas of an occupied building in accordance with the above referenced regulations.</p>
				
<h5>(l) Lead paint.</h5>
<p>Any construction or maintenance operations which will disturb lead based paint will require abatement of those areas pursuant to protocols detailed in the “Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing” (June 1995; U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, D.C. 20410; available at the Office of Facilities Planning, Education Building Annex, Room 1060, State Education Department, Albany, NY 12234). All areas scheduled for construction as well as areas of flaking and peeling paint shall be tested for the presence of lead and abated or encapsulated in accordance with the above noted guidelines.</p>
				
<h5>(m) Radon.</h5>
				
<p>Districts shall take responsibility to be aware of the geological potential for high levels of radon and to test and mitigate as appropriate. This information is available from the New York State Department of Health Radon Measurement Database.</p>
				
<h5>(n) Post construction inspection.</h5>
<p>The school district or board of cooperative educational services shall provide the opportunity for a walk-through inspection by the health and safety committee members to confirm that the area is ready to be reopened for use.</p>
<p>8 CRR-NY 155.5</p>
<p>Current through May 31, 2021</p><br>



<h3>Certificate of Occupancy (CO) and Fire Safety Inspections</h3>
				<ul>
<li>Please note that an active CO becomes invalid if any of the required life safety measures are altered or non-functional due to construction activities or otherwise. Occupying or using any buildings without submission for a Building Permit and a valid Certificate of Occupancy (C.O.) is illegal and potentially dangerous.</li> 

<li>Upon completion of a construction project, the District / BOCES / School and their A/E firm must submit the following documents to OFP in order to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy:</li>
					<ul>
<li>Certificate of Substantial Completion (by the licensed design professional and the District/BOCES Superintendent)</li>
<li>Fire Safety Inspection Report (by a certified third party)</li>
						</ul>

<li>As of 2015, the NYSED Fire Safety Portal System accessed through the Application Business Portal is used to manage all COs.</li> 

<li>The Fire Safety Portal must contain all district buildings, including Sheds, Press Boxes, Storage Containers, Dug Outs, Pavilions, Storage Buildings, etc.</li>

<li>Annual Fire Safety Inspections of all buildings are required by regulation. It is the responsibility of the District / BOCES / School to hire a certified third party perform the fire safety inspections. The District / BOCES / School must also enter the fire inspection data into SED’s Application Business Portal; after which school districts and BOCES can print their own annual certificates of occupancy.</li> 
					
			

<li>FireSafety@nysed.gov is the email for OFP’s Fire Safety unit that is predominantly responsible for assistance with COs</li>

<h3>Energy Management System</h3>
<h3>Section 1</h3><br>
<h4>Energy Management System – Section Overview</h4>
<p>An energy management system (EMS) provides the school district with the essential tools to ensure students have a comfortable and well-ventilated learning environment.  A well-run system will help to reduce critical equipment failures that could lead to an interruption in the school day.</p>

<p>This section of the handbook will summarize the important terms and information surrounding energy management systems.  It is intended to be a reference guide for you use.</p>

<h3>Section 2</h3>

<h3>Section 3</h3> 
<p><em>What can an energy management system control (Schedules, logging)</em></p>

<p>An energy management system can control mechanical equipment and lighting in your building.</p>
<p>Energy management systems allow you to monitor, adjust, schedule, log data, alarm, and troubleshoot systems in your buildings.</p> 
<p>The energy management system can be accessed through workstations in your buildings, web-browsers, mobile devices, and offsite though VPN networks (Refer to section 5 for more information).</p>

<p>Most often the main function of an energy management system is to control temperatures and ventilation rates in the buildings to keep the building environment safe and comfortable.  The energy management system automatically controls temperature and ventilation rates based on the setpoints programmed into the system and can be adjusted as needed.</p>

<p>Schedules can be set for one or multiple pieces of equipment at a time for years into the future.  Schedules allow you to have systems running when areas are occupied to keep occupants comfortable and off to save energy when areas are unoccupied.</p>

<p>Energy management systems can log data for multiple uses.  Often utility meters are monitored so energy and water consumption can be tracked in real time and used to analyze changes in building occupied modes.  Most points in the energy management system are logged and can be reviewed to track system performance and aid in troubleshooting mechanical system issues.</p>

<p>Alarms provide indication of issues in the systems controlled and can vary in severity.   Alarm conditions can be as simple as a fan or pump didn’t shut off when expected or more urgent such as heating loop temperature is low.  Alarms generated by the control system can be sent to operators' workstations or directly to building operators depending on the urgency of the alarm.</p>

<p>Often troubleshooting of mechanical systems begins at the energy management system.  Often an alarm or review of building floor plans will indicate a potential mechanical issue in the building.  By reviewing system graphics and logged points the potential issue can be identified or narrowed down to an area for more efficient field investigation and repairs.</p>



<h3>Section 4</h3> 
<h4>System architecture</h4>

<p>The system architecture of energy management systems varies based on the system manufacturer.  The diagrams and descriptions below are similar to most of the mainstream energy management systems.</p>  

<p>An energy management system is divided into two main sections.</p>

<h5>Section 1:  Devices connected to the district’s network</h5>

<p>System components directly connected to the network include:</p>
<ol type="A">

<li>A system server</li>
<li>Operator workstations / a browser interface</li>
<li>A network level controller</li>
<li>Connection to packaged equipment (Utility meters, Boilers, Chillers, Pumps, VRF systems, Lighting systems)</li>
</ol><br>

<h5>IMPORTANT – These devices require coordination with your IT Department</h5>


<h5>Section 2:  Devices on the dedicated field controller network</h5>
<p>System components directly connected to the network include:</p>
<ol type="A">

<li>An equipment controller (typically one per piece of equipment)</li>
<li>Input sensors (temperatures, equipment run sensors, humidity, CO2 level, alarm contacts, steam pressure)</li>
<li>Outputs (relays to start equipment, valve positioning, damper positioning, variable speed drive setting, outside lighting)</li>
</ol><br>

<p>IMPORTANT – These devices are managed by your energy management system provider.  IT Department coordination is not typically required.</p>

<img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/specialsystems-1.png" class="lgImg" alt="Specialized Systems Example" /><br>
<h3>Section 5</h3> 
<h4></h4>Networks and IT terminology

<p>Below are key networking terms</p>

<h4>VPN</h4>
	<ul>
<li>VPN stands for Virtual Private Network</li>
<li>VPN is a piece of software on your laptop or phone that allows you to connect to the district’s network safely when you are home or off-site.</li>
<li>You will be required to login to the VPN software with your district credentials</li>
<li>NOTE – VPN is used to connect to your Energy Management system when you are at home</li>

<h4>vLan</h4>
<li>vLan stands for Virtual Large Area Network</li>
<li>A vLan allows the IT Department to create a secure network for the network level devices</li>
<li>Specific ports on network switches can be assigned to a vLan</li>
<li>Different vLans can be configured for different departments on the network (students, the business office, security equipment, energy management devices)</li>

<h4>Static IP Address</h4>
<li>A network address that is assigned by the IT Department</li>
<li>The address is hard coded and remains the same</li>

<h4>DHCP IP Address</h4>
<li>DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</li>
<li>DHCP defines a “pool” of IP addresses that are available to randomly select</li>
<li>A device configured to use DHCP will usually receive a different IP address every time it is rebooted</li>

 
<h4>Virtual Server</h4>
<li>A Virtual Server is very large computer that can have multiple copies of Windows software installed and running at one time.</li>
<li>The Facilities Department does not need to maintain and upgrade the Energy Management System server if it housed on the IT Department’s Virtual Server.</li>
<li>Virtual Servers are automatically backed up by the IT Department.</li>
<li>The IT Department can easily reconfigure the Energy Management Server to have more disk drive space or memory if needed.</li>
<li>The term “Virtualized” is used to the Energy Management System Server is on the “large Virtual Server”</li>
		<ul>
<li>Example: “The EMS server has been virtualized”</li>
</ul>

</ul>



 
<h3>Section 6 </h3>
<h4>System Upgrades</h4>

<p>We discussed earlier the different components that make up an energy management system (Refer to section 4).  Periodic upgrades will be required to this technology system.</p>

<p>It is important to schedule upgrades regularly.  We will discuss the different system components, the rationale for upgrading, and the timing when you should consider upgrades.</p>

<p><h4>IMPORTANT NOTE: </h4>Be sure to discuss suggested upgrades with your energy management system provider when you are planning a capital project or creating your building condition survey.</p>
 
<h5>Computer Equipment Operating System Software Upgrades (System Server and Operator Workstations)</h5>
<ul>

<li>UPGRADE FREQUENCY:  3 to 5 years</li>
<li>The system server and operator workstation each have two software components.  They are the Operating System Version and the Energy Management System software version.</li>
<li>The Operating System Version is typically a Microsoft product (Windows Server OS, Windows 10, Windows 11). </li> 
<li>This will be the most frequent upgraded component.</li>
<li>The IT Department will often request these upgrades in an effort to maintain the network safety policies.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Computer Equipment Physical Computer (System Server and Operator Workstations)</h5>
<ul>

<h3>Section 7</h3>
<h4>Service (service departments, service contracts, training)</h4>

<p>Your energy management vendor’s service department can be one of your greatest assets to maintaining the comfort, ventilation rates, and energy use of your buildings.</p>

<p>The service department should provide 24/7 service with field and help desk support available during business hours and technicians on call for emergency after-hours calls.</p>

<p>It is important for the service department to have remote access to the system.  This allows for the fastest and most efficient response to your service calls.  Remote access may also allow the service team to show you the issues they find so you can identify and possibly correct the issues yourself in the future.</p>

<p>Service agreements also help to maintain your system.  Agreements are optional so you should ask your energy management system vendor if you have an agreement and what is covered.</p>

<p>Agreements can range from preventative maintenance only to extended parts and technical services coverage.  Preventative maintenance agreements help maintain the overall health of the system and include visits from an experienced technician that does a thorough review of the control system to identify and correct potential issues in the system.  Extended parts and services agreements also include replacement of parts that have failed unexpectedly.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - Your energy management vendor can provide training on your system.  It is recommended to get training for you and any staff that might use the energy management system.</p>

				<div class="topic-header">SWIMMING POOL MAINTENANCE</div>
					<div class="text-content">
						<p>It is important to effectively manage the routine maintenance, repairs and chemistry of your pool to ensure the safety of bathers.  This section will describe the basic systems incorporated into a pool as well as other key elements to be aware of in safely managing one.</p>

<h4>Overview of Systems</h4>

<p>Your pool combines several different systems, each with particular considerations for the safety of occupants, including but not limited to protection from things such as waterborne illnesses and drowning hazards.  The pool systems are designed by an engineer, and approved by either your Local Health Department or the NYS Health Department to meet legally mandated criteria such as turnover rates, flow rates across drain covers, and capacity to maintain disinfection. Alterations to any such system requires Department of Health approval.</p> 

	<h4>Circulation</h4>
		<p>The pool water is circulated by a main circulation pump from the pool, through a heating system, chemical control system, and filtration system, and then back into the pool.  In many instances there is also a surge tank which exists to balance water level changes which occur when bathers enter and exit the pool.  Pump specifications are determined by the design engineer and require a ‘turnover’ of no greater than 6 hours.  This means that ‘The entire volume of pool water must be recirculated and treated in six hours.’  The pump typically draws a majority of its water volume through the main drain(s) at the bottom of the pool and additionally through a skimmer or gutter system at the top of the pool.  The flow from each is usually metered using butterfly valves.</p> 
		
	<h4>Chemical control</h4>
		<p>The chemistry of pool water is regulated by the NYS Sanitary Code which establishes specific criteria for both the PH of your pool water and the disinfectant level.  Additional chemistry considerations should be considered for both improved water quality and the longevity of the pool’s plumbing and mechanical systems.</p>
						<ul>

		<li><strong>Disinfectants</strong> - Commonly used Disinfectants include Chlorine (as Sodium Hypochlorite or Calcium Hypochlorite) and Bromine.  Other disinfectants exist, but their use is less common.  It is important to maintain the minimum disinfectant level, while also understanding how the disinfectant your pool uses impacts the pH level of the water.  Chlorine disinfectants, for example, tend to raise the water’s pH level because they themselves have a very high pH.  Bromine on the other hand, lowers the pH level of the water.  Since NYS Sanitary Code also places requirements on a pool’s PH, it is important to understand the impact of your disinfectant.</li>
			
		<li><strong>pH Balance</strong> - pH is a scale used to determine how acidic or basic and aqueous solution is.  The pH level of a pool must be maintained within the range as mandated by NYS Sanitary Code. For pools using a chlorine disinfectant, Muriatic Acid or Carbon Dioxide are commonly used to manage the pH level of the water.  For pools using Bromine as a disinfectant, Sodium Carbonate (or Soda Ash) is commonly used to manage the PH level.</li>
						
		<li><strong>Alkalinity</strong> - Alkalinity can be viewed as a ‘pH buffer.’  That is, maintaining an appropriate Alkalinity level of 80-120 ppm in your pool will have a limiting effect on how the pH of your pool responds to sudden and frequent changes in bather load, disinfectant residual, etc.  Chemicals such as Sodium Bicarbonate exist to help raise the alkalinity of your pool.  It is generally considered best practice to ensure that the pool’s pH level is correct before working to raise the alkalinity.</li>
						
		<li><strong>Calcium Hardness</strong> - Calcium Hardness is a measure in PPM of calcium in a pool.  As part of the Langlier Saturation Index calculation, calcium hardness can be manipulated, within its recommended range of 200 ppm - 400 ppm, to ensure that water quality issues do not lead to scale or calcium buildup within the pool’s plumbing and mechanical systems.</li>
						
		<li><strong>Automatic Feed Systems</strong> - To maintain proper disinfection and pH balance, commercial pools use an automatic feed system.  Feed systems typically consist of 2 probe sensors to detect which chemical dispensing system to turn on and off.  One probe reads the pH level of the pool water, and the other typically reads disinfectant in ppm or the ‘oxidation reduction potential’ (ORP).  The ORP reading is the most common, and it is important to note that ORP does not have a direct relationship to the amount of disinfectant in the water, as it is also highly dependent on the pH levels of the water.  For this reason it is very important to ensure a correct and accurate pH reading before making adjustments.</li>  
		
			<li><strong>Chemical Testing/reagents</strong> - In order to maintain proper chemistry, a Pool Operator should have a complete set of testing reagents available at all times.  Reagents expire and sight glasses become cloudy with time and use.  Replace reagents and test kit components as needed.</li>
						
		<li><strong>Dosing/Treating Manually/Including volume measurements</strong> - There will be times, such as at seasonal start-up, during a contamination event, or in response to chemical imbalances, when manual dosing of pool water will be required.  In order to do so, it will be important to follow label directions and have an accurate understanding of the volume of water being treated.  Measuring the volume of water in a pool is covered in detail in most Pool Operator certification courses.  Label instructions will include methods for adding chemicals to pool water which may include methods such as mixing into solution, broadcasting, etc.  Following specific label instructions, including using PPE as required, ensures both that the chemical works properly and that the pool operator avoids injury.</li>
		
			<li><strong>LSI for protection of equipment/piping</strong> - The ‘Langlier Saturation Index’ is a calculation which combines metrics such as pH, Free Chlorine, Calcium Hardness, Alkalinity and temperature to determine the overall balance of metals within the water in a pool.  This calculation determines whether the water is corrosive, scale-forming, or ‘balanced.’  The various inputs to the equation can be manipulated to ensure balanced water levels that will not have adverse effects on the pool’s plumbing system.  There are various calculators and apps available which allow a pool operator to input readings from their pool water to determine which levels to manipulate in order to achieve balanced water.  This is reviewed in detail in most Pool Operator certification courses.</li>
						</ul>

	<h4>Heating</h4>
		<p>Pool heating systems vary greatly depending on the design and age of the pool.  It is typical to see heat exchangers utilizing a building's hot water heating system, standalone direct fired heaters, or combinations of many systems.  These systems require regular maintenance in the same manner as the rest of a building’s heating system.  It is also important to note that the temperature of the water can impact the overall LSI calculation of your water, and is a variable that can be manipulated within that calculation to prevent damage to the pool system components.</p>

	<h4>Filtration</h4>
<p>The pool water passes through a filtration system in order to eliminate dirt and debris.  Various filter types include sand, diatomaceous earth and cartridge.  Pool filter type, size and specifications as well as pool turnover time are important considerations that the design engineer takes into account when designing a pool system in order to meet required filtration needs.  Regular filter maintenance includes backwashing sand filters, and cleaning or replacing cartridges and diatomaceous earth.  Regular maintenance is typically performed at frequencies based on a pressure differential at the filter.  Occasional filter maintenance includes tasks such as cleaning the top layer of sand in a sand filter, replacing sand and other filter components, and changing diatomaceous earth.  All maintenance tasks should be completed in accordance with the manufacturer’s prescribed maintenance schedules and procedures.</p>		

 <h4>Sanitary Code</h4> 

	<p>The rules and regulations surrounding the operations of a public swimming pool can be found in NYS Sanitary Code SubPart 6-1.  Regulations cover items ranging from pool construction, operation, water quality and air quality to supervision and other requirements.  As a Director of Facilities, you may be responsible for some or all of these regulations, so it is important to be familiar with this code and have it readily available.</p>
	

<h4>Other</h4> 

	<h4>Common Issues</h4>
						<ul>
	<li><strong>Turbidity</strong> -  Turbidity can be a common water quality issue.  When your pool water is cloudy, it is a safety concern because it inhibits the ability for the lifeguard(s) to properly supervise the pool.  In fact, if the pool is cloudy to the point that the main drain of the pool is not clearly visible, the pool should be closed until the issue is resolved.  Further, turbidity indicates that there are suspended particles in the water, which can include soil, organic matter, and algae.  Turbidity can be an indicator of inadequate filtration as a result of filter pressure, cleanliness, or flow rate, or it can be an indicator that there is a chemical imbalance.  If your water is cloudy, start by checking disinfection levels, pool turnover rate, and filter condition.</li>
						
	<li><strong>Contamination</strong> -   Fecal contamination of a swimming pool can be a cause for a variety of recreational water illnesses including Cryptosporidium, Giardia, E.Coli and Hepatitis A.  The unique dangers posed by fecal contamination require a unique response, which is outlined in this NYS Fact Sheet and on the  NYS DOH Website.  In some cases, free chlorine levels in the pool may need to be raised to between 10 and 40 ppm for periods ranging from 6.5 hours to 25.5 hours.  The guidance linked above goes into great detail regarding the prescribed response and should be strictly followed in such an instance.</li>
						
	<li><strong>Algae</strong>-  Algae in swimming pools can be caused by a combination of improper filtration, disinfection and circulation.  Proper treatment of algae includes a combination of several corrective actions.  Filtration and circulation issues should be corrected, and the pool should be shocked.  Agitation is required, sometimes multiple times, to allow the disinfectant to continue to kill the algae.  Once visible algae has all been removed, use of an aglaecide, continued regular brushing, and proper chemical balance will be key to keeping it at bay.  For black algae and other hard-to get rid of algaes, other considerations include cleaning filters, additional shocking of the pool, and continued scrubbing of pool walls and floor.  When shocking the pool or using an algaecide, always follow label directions and utilize proper PPE.</li>
							</ul><br>

<h4>Certification</h4>

	<p>NYS Sanitary Code SubPart 6-1 requires that a public swimming pool be operated by a qualified operator.  Certified Pool Operator (CPO) courses are offered by organizations such as the Pool and Hot Tub Alliance.  Becoming certified is an important step in understanding pool operations and equipment to the level required by the code.  It is worthwhile to employ multiple Certified Pool Operators to ensure consistent and capable management of a school's swimming pool(s).</p>

<h4>Chloramines</h4>

	<p>Chloramines are irritants that form as free chlorine binds to the body waste of swimmers.  They can become a significant respiratory irritant to bathers as they gas off from the water and hover at its surface.  In addition to respiratory distress, chloramines can cause eye and skin irritation as well as a distinct odor in the natatorium environment.  Control methods include proper disinfection and limiting the amount of combined chlorine as well as air handling strategies and simple bather rules such as showering before bathing, wearing bathing caps and proper hygiene.  The CDC has issued several recommendations for the management of Chloramines in Pool Operation which can be a valuable tool in the Pool Operator’s toolbox.</p>




<h4>Preventative Maintenance</h4>

	<p>Pool systems can be complex and include equipment just like the rest of our educational facilities.  Equipment such as pumps, filters, electronic controllers, heat exchangers, and boilers are just a few examples.  Just like those systems throughout the rest of a school building, pool systems too require preventative maintenance as prescribed by the manufacturer.  Such maintenance procedures can include regular filter backwashing and cleaning, replacement of peristaltic pump tubes, cleaning and lubing filter plungers and gaskets, greasing motors, and cleaning chemical sensing probes.  Each piece of equipment in the pool mechanical room should be inventoried and added to the school’s preventative maintenance schedule as defined by the manufacturer’s specifications.</p>
		
	<h4>Virginia Graeme Baker Act/Drain Covers</h4>

	<p>The Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act (VGB) was established in response to a tragedy claiming the life of a 7 year old child who became entrapped in a faulty drain cover in a public swimming pool.  Drain covers have since been redesigned to comply with new standards that limit their potential for entrapments.  The new standards address various types of entrapments and place specific limits on water flow rates across the surface of the drain cover.  All swimming pool drain covers must be VGB compliant.  Drain covers with stamped expiration dates must be replaced prior to their expiration and replacement covers must meet or exceed the same standards, as approved by a licensed design professional and the Authority Having Jurisdiction.</p>   

	<h4>Regulating Agencies</h4>

	<p>Depending on location, public swimming pools will be regulated by either the local office of the NYS Department of Health, or the Local Health Department, who will perform regular inspections, issue required permits, approve pool design (in addition to approval and permit requirements through NYSED office of Facilities Planning) and serve as the Authority Having Jurisdiction.</p>

				<div class="topic-header">TOOLS FOR THE JOB</div>
					<div class="text-content">
						
						<p>There are a few basic tools that will help you do your job and should be available for you to use.  You will certainly deal with complaints about temperatures in classrooms, humidity levels, lighting levels, etc.  Your district may have these and if not, here is a good place to start.  For about $2,000 you can get about all the tools you will need to help you with some important diagnostic work and facility planning.  Some of the tools listed below overlap in what they can do, so depending on your budget, you can buy one tool that does the job of three.  These tools are not necessarily for use by your staff, but they will provide you with a few handy diagnostic tools.</p>

<p><strong>Thermal Camera Imaging Tool</strong> – FLIR TG165 or similar.  This can be used to not only measure <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-33.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="Eyewash Fountain"/></section>the temperature in a room, but the thermal camera can be used to diagnose hot water flow, air flow, ceiling units, and pipes behind walls.  Take this and walk around your building and scan all your HVAC devices in the winter to easily see what is working and what is not. Cost of $550 or more for the thermal imaging temperature gun.</p>



<p><strong>Moisture Meter</strong> – This is great tool, but it does come at a higher cost and is the most expensive item we have listed in this section.  If you must deal with a mold issue, this is the tool you will want.  You can get an instant reading on the meter for temperature and relative humidity.  The imaging camera is great for identifying wet areas, along with thermal images showing hot and cold spots.  You can download images from the meter which will help you in documenting the status of an area in question.  Most meters will include a moisture probe that can be used to verify wet areas in a wall or even in roof insulation.  These range in costs from $600 to $1,700, depending on the features you desire.  This will do what the thermal imaging gun can do, but it has the moisture capabilities.</p>  





<p><strong>Data Logger</strong> – These can be simple or complex, but most will record temperatures and humidity at set intervals.  You can get models that have multiple inputs so you can measure temperatures <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-22.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt=""/></section>across a univent in case you are concerned with flow through a coil.  This is a great tool to put in a room and record temperatures and humidity when you are getting complaints that a room gets cold or hot as a certain time of day.  You can download the recorded data and use that as a diagnostic tool.  You can buy these for around $250 to $350.  Price will vary depending on the features you want.</p>


<p><strong>Anemometer:</strong>  <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-1.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="Anemometer"/></section>This meter is used to measure air flow.  You will need this to test your science lab hoods and it is also great to use with univents, exhaust fans, and ductwork.  These come in a few different configurations and with optional features.  The meter pictured has a handheld detached vane, while other models have the vane attached to the digital meter portion.  The detached vane makes it a little easier to view the readings when you are measuring in hard to get to spaces.  The reading you will use most often is CFM and for a cost of under $200, you can get a meter that measures up to 9,999 CFMs.  With a little ingenuity, you can fabricate an adapter to pair with this meter to cover over a 24” x 24” diffuser and get an accurate measurement of air flow.</p>  

<p><strong>Humidity Meter:</strong> <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-2.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="Humidity Meter"/></section> If you cannot afford to buy the thermal imaging camera, this is the next best option.  It will give you an instant reading on temperature and relative humidity.  If you have the funds, the data logger and thermal imaging camera are your best tools in dealing with humidity concerns.  Those tools will allow you to provide data on the circumstances you are working with.  You can show the recorded readings from the data logger, along with thermal imaging scans that will also show the humidity and temperature measured.  Those items will provide the data to show you did your due diligence in investigating the problem.  It will also give you the data to back the need for making changes to alter the conditions you found in the room in question.  A good meter will cost you around $300.</p><br><br>



<p><strong>Laser Distance Meter:</strong> <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-3.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="Laser Distance Meter"/></section> This is a handy tool to measure large areas and it is much easier to take measurements by yourself with this device when compared to a tape measure.  These laser distance meters come in many shapes and sizes.  You can get meters with a range of 30 feet up to 500 feet or more.  A Bosch meter with up to 164 ft in range is about $100, which is quite reasonable.  Accuracy on most of these distance meters is +/- 1/16”.</p>









<p><strong>Walking Wheel:</strong> <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-4.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="Walking Wheel"/></section> As simple as this item is, you are going to need this.  Thinking of running a water line, electrical circuit outside, adding a sidewalk, replacing fence, and whatever else you do that involves several hundred feet or more of measuring, this is the tool.  Suggested that you purchase one with a 12” wheel as the models with the smaller wheels do not work well outdoors.  You can get a nice one for under $100.</p>





<p><strong>Label Maker:</strong> <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-5.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="Label Maker"/></section> Great item that you will use more than you think. Great to use on electrical panels, storeroom shelving, exit signs, doors, emergency lights, fire extinguishers, HVAC units, and more.  Most of the labels you will print will be in the ¼” to ¾” width range.  You can go a lot further and buy a label maker to generate labels for pipes and to create warning labels, but I would suggest you compare the cost of purchasing preprinted labels versus the cost of a large printer and printing materials.  You can get a nice label maker for around $100.</p>







<p><strong>Gloss Meter:</strong> <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-6.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="Gloss Meter"/></section> This meter is used to measure the gloss on your floors.  Great tool to know when floors need burnishing or a fresh coat of wax.  Floors dull over time and with this tool, you can set a hard number to when specific actions are taken with your floors.  Example, burnish whenever the gloss meter reads below 40.  It provides a fantastic way to know exactly when floors need extra care.  If you measure the gloss on your hallway floors each month and address them as the numbers dictate, you will never have dull floors in your buildings.  There is nothing better than getting comments from visitors to your building who say how shiny your floors look.  Cost of $200 to $300.</p>




<p><strong>Light Meter</strong> <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-7.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="Light Meter"/></section> A handy tool to measure light levels inside and outside.  Good to use when you get complaints about parking lots not being well lit, or light levels in the classrooms.  Also, the meter is particularly useful on your sports fields.  There are minimum requirements for light levels on a sports field and you should be following these levels to avoid liability for injuries.  If you have HID lighting, note that the lighting levels (lumens) drop significantly over time.  You will need this tool to know when to relamp your light arrays.  Meters will measure in Foot Candles and in Lumens.  Cost of $100 to $200.</p>




<p><strong>Hard Hat with Light:</strong> <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-8.png" class="xsmImg" alt="Hard Hat and Light"/></section> If you have a crawl space, you will need one of these.  It is strongly recommended that you enter the crawlspace with one of these along with a flashlight.  If you have ever been in an area of a crawlspace that is unlit and your flashlight dies, you know why 2 lights are necessary.  There are always the hanging supports, low beams, and ductwork corners that always find a way to contact our heads.</p>  





<p><strong>Watt Meter:</strong> <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-9.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="Watt Meter"/></section> This is a handy tool when you are looking at reducing energy costs, and you can get one for less than $50.  These are used to measure power usage to help reduce energy in your buildings at outlets.  You can use this to see how much energy you are consuming to power refrigerators, microwave oven, and coffee makers that staff has brought in from home.</p>  








<p><strong>CO2 and Indoor Air Quality Meter</strong><section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-10.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="CO2 Meter"/></section> The CO2 meter is a valuable tool to help when dealing with indoor air quality.  If you have concerns with air changes or if your occupancy detectors are CO2 based, this is going to come in handy. These have a cost of under $400 and like other tools, you can have more features that add additional costs.</p>







<p><strong>ATP Clean Meter</strong><section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-11.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="ATP Meter"/></section> If you want to measure how clean a surface is, this is the tool you will need.  This meter, along with the disposable swabs, will measure the amount of biological residue on a surface.  All organic matter contains ATP and that includes both living and non-living matter.  After you clean a surface, you swab an area and then insert the swab into the meter to view the measurement, which indicates the amount of ATP remaining on the surface.  This is handy to show staff how well they are doing with respect to cleaning desks and touch points.  The meter is around $1,700 and the swabs will cost you around $2.50 each.</p>  





<p><strong>Sound Level Meter</strong> <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-12.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="Sound Level Meter"/></section> A lot of the equipment you use, especially that used to maintain your grounds, came with a decibel output tag.  The sound level rating should be used to determine if hearing protection is required to be worn by your staff.  Over years of use, many pieces of equipment will get louder as parts start to exhibit normal wear. Taking a sound level reading annually is a wise idea and you should document the reading as well.  You can purchase a meter that has a range of thirty-five decibels to 130 decibels for under $200.</p>



<p><strong>Borescope Inspection Camera</strong> <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-13.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="Borescope Inspection Camera"/></section>It is reported by a staff member that they hear water dripping behind the classroom wall and they think is going to lead to mold.  You do not hear it, but you need to check without removing large sections of drywall.  The answer is to use a Borescope Camera.  You have a flexible cable with an inspection camera on the end that you can easily guide into a hole 3/8” or smaller to view the unknown conditions.  These cameras come with different lengths of cable, but three feet of cable is typical on the most common models.  You can but these for around $200 and can spend a lot more depending on how many bells and whistles you would like.</p> 

<p><strong>Combustible Gas Detector</strong> <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-14.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="Gas Detector"/></section> These detectors will sense Natural Gas (Methane), Propane, Butane, and more.  Necessary item when you get called for a gas smell in your kitchen or a mechanical room.  These are less than $200 and easy to use.</p>






<p><strong>AutoCad LT</strong> <section><img src="../NewHandbookGrid/Images/tools-15.jpg" class="xsmImg" alt="AutoCad"/></section> If you do not know AutoCad, learning this program can be extremely beneficial.  Typically, your architect will not provide you with any cad drawings, but it does not prevent you from creating them.  Your HS Technology staff may help you with this.  A great student project is to draw the school and grounds.  Otherwise, you can take your walking wheel, laser measuring device and start creating on your own.  There are many YouTube videos that you can watch and learn how to draw in AutoCad.  Once you have a basic print created, you can use them to help manage your facility.  Prints showing all the valves on your hot water heating system, all your motorized valves, fire system components, all HVAC mechanical devices, and more are extremely beneficial.  The software can be purchased through BOCES and your IT department, and your district may already have licenses for one of your Tech classes.</p>

				<div class="topic-header">ASSET AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT</div>
					<div class="text-content">
						<p>Managing the inventory list of your district’s assets may be a part of your responsibility.  There are two type of inventory that we will cover, and that is capital assets (equipment) and consumable assets (custodial supplies, pool chemicals, grass seed, etc.).</p> 
						
						<h3>Capital Assets</h3>
						<p>Your district should determine at what value does an asset require an Asset Tag.  Your Business Administrator can tell you the value of a product that requires the creation of an Asset Tag.   There may also be debate on what constitutes an asset that requires an Asset Tag.  One thought process is if the asset is fixed to the building, and it would not be something you would move if you were to relocate/sell your school, then it does not get an asset tag.  Good examples of this would be a univent, stage lighting, or a boiler, as you would not remove these types of equipment if you were to sell the building.  Vehicles, tractors, autoscrubbers, computers, welders, and fitness center equipment are examples of assets that would require a tag if their purchase price were above the value set by the district.  If your threshold is $500, then a Zero Turn mower would get a tag, but a $450 vacuum cleaner may not. Asset tags also provide a way to keep track of equipment purchases and their location.  Auditors may ask you how you keep track of tools such as cordless drills.  For those reasons, it is a clever idea to at least add these to your equipment lists (items valued under your threshold) in your CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System).</p> 
						
<p>If you do not control Capital Assets through your CMMS, then you should have a spreadsheet to manage them.  Information typically documented for the assets would be Make, Model, Serial Number, Description, Date Purchased, Purchase Price, Purchase Order Number, Vendor, Asset Tag Number, Expected Life of the Asset, and Location of the Asset.  All this information should also be placed in your CMMS for any assets that are in your department or assets that you will maintain.  Assets purchased through your IT Department such as laptops, chromebooks, smartboards, televisions, and so on, should be managed by the IT Department.  Depending on the size of your district, the number of Technology Assets can be quite large, and these items are frequently transferred between students and between staff members.  This is not an area you want to manage assets if possible.</p>
						
<p>You can purchase pre-printed asset tags, and these Asset Tags must have unique numbers.  Some CMMS programs can perform Asset Management and can create a unique bar code label.  If you are going to create your own asset tag labels, be sure the tags are weatherproof and fade resistant.  When you place a tag on a piece of equipment, aim to put the tag in a location that is visible, but not in a location where it will be subjected to damage.  Asset management gets difficult when you cannot read a tag or when an asset has multiple tags because someone could not discover the original tag on the equipment.  Some districts will utilize an outside company to audit and assist in the management of your assets.  Ask your Business Administrator about this. Your district auditors will ask to see a list of your assets, and many will also ask you to locate specific items from the list in your buildings, which is why it is important to document where assets will be stored.
If you are the keeper of the asset list, you will want to have a form for asset tag creation, asset disposal, and possibly one for asset transfer.  Do not create a new asset tag for an item until that piece has been received by the purchaser, and you have all the necessary information. These forms make asset management much easier.  Example forms are provided for you, and you can edit these generic sheets to adapt to the requirements of your district.</p>
						
<p>Asset Disposition or Asset Surplus is the term used to describe an asset that is no longer needed.  The process to surplus an asset will also vary by district policy.  The question that you must answer with respect to this is does the asset have value.  The value of the asset will assist in determining how the asset will be disposed of.  You simple just cannot throw things away, give them away, sell them, or auction them without going through the proper channels.  The common procedure is to submit an item for disposition that will be approved by your school board.  For example, you have a 12-year-old zero turn mower that still runs, but it has seen better days.  The mower will have some value and should be disposed of in the proper manner.  In this case, you would submit the item for approval to be deemed surplus, and when you receive approval, you would submit the item for auction, as it still has fair value.</p>
						
<p>There are several options for auctioning surplus equipment.  Many use the online site Auctions International, and others will send their surplus items to a local consignment auction.  You will have several choices but be sure the items are available for the public to bid on.  If you do not get any bids on an item you send to auction, you can then deem that asset to have no value.  In this case you would submit the surplus item for approval and note that the asset has no value and should be scrapped.  A broken chair may be submitted initially as surplus to be scrapped, as it has no value.  Again, speak to your Business Administrator as to how these things are handled in your district.</p>
						
<h3>Consumable Assets</h3>
<p>This constitutes items you purchase regularly but still need to keep track of. Audits will ask you how you manage this inventory and how would you know if products are missing.  Keeping consumables stored in a secure location is one way and having one person distribute and adjust inventory levels in another.  Limiting the number of storerooms for your comsumables also helps to streamline the process.  I have marked items out of inventory as soon as they leave the main storeroom. I don't count items in each janitor's closet, but that would be something you may do to keep tighter controls on consumables.  Find a method that works best for you and your district. Using your CMMS to manage inventory seems to be the best method. Being able to produce an inventory report at a moments notice is key.  Having procedures in place to account for inventory entering and being dispurse is also important.</p>
						
						
<h4>Example of how to manage comsumable inventory with a CMMS</h4>
				<ul>		
		<li>All consumables are placed into the CMMS with accurate inventory figures, including supplier, costs, and minimum and maximum inventory levels.</li>
		<li>Items are distributed to the districts builds by way of a work order.</li>
		<li>Workorder requests are placed by the buildings Head Custodian/Sr. Custodian with a list of supplies needed.</li>
		<li>Inventory is then gathered and delivered to the building making the supply request.</li>
		<li>When the workorder has been completed and closed out, the inventory levels in the main storage room are automatically adjusted.</li>
		<li>Limit requests for supplies to once or twice per month.</li>
		<li>Run a report to show which products are below the minimum inventory level and are need to be replentished.</li>
		<li>Create Purchase Requisitions in your CMMS that you will used to create purchase orders in your districts purchasing software.</li> 
		<li>When the orders are received, you simply update the purchase requisition in your CMMS to received.</li>
		<li>Run an annual report to show the amount of product consumed in past year and use that information to budget for next year's <a href="https://www.p12.nysed.gov/facplan/documents/MPS_2022_FINAL_Revised_03-29-2023.pdf" target="new">consumable</a> orders.</li>

					<div class="text-content">

<p>Many of us from the older generation still refer to them as blueprints from the days when they were made with blue ink, but today they are referred to as just prints.  Print management is important and can be a life saver when you need information in a hurry, such as locating a water shutoff valve when a pipe has burst.</p>  

<p><strong>Print Management</strong> - If you do not have all your prints hung on print holders or some type of print filing system, and organized in a logical manner, then you have a new task.  Storing your prints like the picture to the left can create lots of extra time and effort to find the right print.  There are many ways to organize your prints and your method should be such that it allows you to find information in the shortest time possible.  You can store prints in a variety of ways and each method has its advantages and disadvantages.  Choose the system that works best for you.</p>  



<p>Vertical Roll File Holder – This is good item for storing prints short term, or for odd prints you will not use often, but storing prints rolled up can make them a challenge to lay flat when viewing them.  This file holder does have the advantage of being able to store a large number of prints in a small footprint of space.</p>





Print Drawer File Cabinets- These are an excellent choice when you are storing prints that are single sheets or maybe a few sheets, but this will become an expensive path if you choose to store a large quantity of files in these drawer units.  They do have an advantage of providing the best protection for prints and it is an excellent method to store old documents that are getting brittle and torn.  These drawers are also quite easy to label and thus makes organizing your prints a simple task.  A good tip with this system is to mark your prints as to which drawer they are stored in, so prints do not get misfiled.  These drawer units can cost over $2,000.




Horizontal Print Rack – These are terrific to mount on the wall and they are nice to hold the smaller “B” size prints.  They are inexpensive, and they can hold a large number of prints in a small area.  However, they have the same disadvantage as the vertical bin in that prints are stored in rolls and labeling this type of rack can be challenging.  If you have a rubber band around the prints, you can ship a piece of paper under the rubber band that identifies the prints.  That method seems to work best to easily find a set of prints on this style of print holder.







Portable Print Racks – These racks offer good storage and can be easily moved around.  Having one of these is certainly handy to hang and move prints when you are doing work in a specific area that requires you to regularly access a few sets of prints.  These are also nice because they hang the prints in flat vertical manner, which helps to keep the prints flat.  When storing prints in this way, be certain the printer holders can grip the size prints you are storing.  It never hurts to tighten the nut on the print grip with pliers, so they do not fall out after a while.


Wall Mounted Print Hangers – This type of system for organizing prints offers a lot of benefits.  These allow for easy organization and identification to find prints quickly.  Just like the portable racks, these allow your prints to stay flat.  The key to using this system is having a wall that you can secure the brackets which will support the weight of the file holders.  As you know, a set of prints can be heavy.  You will notice in the picture to the left that a shelf was placed over the print racks.  This shelf is great for storing you project manuals.  This type of setup offers much for storing all you project related materials.

Creating a Capital Project Print list to display the Capital Project numbers available for each of your buildings.  This document that will assist you when you are looking for certain types of prints.  This is a great piece of information to hang on your wall in your blueprint storage area.  You could also add the location of these project prints to the sheet as well.  You will notice in the spreadsheet that each building has a number, which is the sixth set of digits in the SED building code.  In the example below the High School is building 001 and the Elementary School is 015.  The three digits after the building number are the project numbers.  The last project that was done at the High School was number 013.  The next time this district does a project at the High School it will be project 014 and the Elementary School will be 011.  Even though a capital project has work at two buildings at the same time, which does not mean they will be assigned the same number.  In other words, just because the High School is doing project 014, that does not mean the other buildings will be doing project 014.  In the list below you will also notice some gaps in project numbers, which could imply that those prints were either lost or destroyed.

Each time you carry out a Capital Project, your architect generates several print sets that will be given to your district.  Not every architectural firm will generate prints in the same manner, so you should ask how you can expect to receive prints.  Typical print types that you may receive from your architect are SED Set, Bid Set, Construction Set, and As-Built Set.  Your architectural firm will discuss the timing to 
SED Prints – This set of prints are the first prints generated and are sent to SED for project approval.  These prints are not always detailed but cover the gist of what project work is being proposed.  For example, you may have a print showing the replacement of a drop ceiling in a classroom, but the orientation of these ceiling tiles may be different on the print set that goes out for bid.  Some Architectural firms will use the same set of prints that went to SED as the bid set.  If SED asked for changes to print details prior to approving the project work, those changes are updated on the prints before going out for bid.
Bid Set Prints – These are the prints that contractors wishing to bid on your project will receive so they can create cost estimates and generate a bid for the project.  Some architects will detail these prints so they serve as the Construction Set, while others will create a separate set of prints for Construction prints.  The Bid Set has enough details to allow the prospective bidders to properly generate a cost to construct figure.  
Construction Set – This set has more dimensional details than the Bid Set.  The Bid Set may show doors in a new addition but not the exact location of the door along a wall.  The construction set will show the door to be four feet from the east wall.  
As-Built Set – This is the set that is turned over to you at the end of the project.  Typically, these prints are the Construction Set with lots of notes showing deviations from the original document.  If no changes were made to an area depicted on a print, the print will look exactly like the Construction Set print.  As-Built prints are the most important for you to view as they indicate the actual details as they were constructed.  Some contractors will create a new print for you showing the as-built conditions, while others will made “Red Line” notes on the construction set.  Before beginning a project, it is good practice to specify what you expect in your as-built drawings.  When a water line or power conduit is discovered in a location that is not shown on your prints, be certain the new location is documented.  If possible, take a picture of the discovered utility line and do not assume the contractor has taken time to document the location of the utility line.  Experience will tell you to not assume a gas line or water line is where it is shown on the print.  That is why it is important to get the As-Built prints to reflect existing conditions as close as possible.
Design or Bid Sets of prints are usually provided in multiple sets, but As-Built prints are commonly received as one set.  If you have more than one set of prints from a Bid Set, you may choose to split one of the sets by building.  Everyone will have a different opinion on how they want to organize their prints, but an ideal print room has a section of As-Built prints, Prints by Building and Trade (Plumbing, HVAC, Electrical, Site, Architectural, Life Safety, etc.), and Prints by Project.  Sometimes As-Built prints will only contain prints that were deviated from the Bid Set that was provided to the contractor.  You might have an electrical As-Built print set from a capital project that contains only four pages, but the bid set has twenty-four pages of electrical prints.  When you are doing a capital project, make it known up front how you would like to receive your As-Built prints.  This can be a full set with changes noted, or just the pages with changes only.  Most times you will get an electronic copy of the print and a paper copy.  It is strongly recommended that you get a paper copy and not just an electronic copy.  Being able to see the whole picture on a full-size print can be much easier that trying to trace through what is displayed on your computer screen.
You can also have your full-sized prints scanned and stored as an electronic copy.  Note that older prints that are true blueprints are not always as legible as the paper copies.  DO NOT discard your paper prints after scanning.  Once you do that, you can never get them back and printing out paper copies from the electronic version will not produce a copy that will be of the same quality as the original scanned print.
